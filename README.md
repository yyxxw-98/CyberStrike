### Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g @cyberstrike-io/cyberstrike@latest && cyberstrike
```

That's it. CyberStrike launches a TUI in your terminal, asks for your LLM provider and API key on first run, and you're ready to go. Tell it what to test — it handles reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and reporting autonomously.

> **Already have a Claude Code or OpenAI subscription?** CyberStrike's intelligence layer sits on top of your existing AI subscription. No separate API costs — your current plan powers an entire pentest toolkit.

Explore the full documentation at **[docs.cyberstrike.io](https://docs.cyberstrike.io)** or visit **[cyberstrike.io](https://cyberstrike.io)** for demos and guides.

---

### Intelligence Layer

CyberStrike isn't just a wrapper around an LLM. It's an intelligence layer that transforms any AI model into an offensive security specialist.

**How it works:** When you connect your LLM provider, CyberStrike injects domain-specific context — OWASP testing methodology, vulnerability patterns, attack chain reasoning, and tool orchestration logic — into every interaction. The model doesn't need to know security; CyberStrike teaches it.

**What the intelligence layer provides:**

- **Schema normalization** — Structured output from any provider, regardless of response format differences
- **Context guard** — Prevents prompt leakage and keeps the agent focused on the current test phase
- **Provider auto-detection** — Automatically identifies your LLM endpoint and configures the optimal transport
- **Tool orchestration** — Chains security tools intelligently based on findings, not fixed scripts

**15+ LLM providers supported out of the box:**

| Provider                  | Models                   | Notes                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Anthropic**             | Claude 4.5, Claude 4     | Best performance with extended thinking |
| **OpenAI**                | GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini     | Full tool-use support                   |
| **Google**                | Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash     | Long context for large codebases        |
| **Amazon Bedrock**        | All Bedrock models       | IAM auth, no API keys needed            |
| **Azure OpenAI**          | All Azure-hosted models  | Enterprise deployments                  |
| **Groq**                  | LLaMA, Mixtral           | Ultra-fast inference                    |
| **Mistral**               | Mistral Large, Codestral | European data residency                 |
| **DeepSeek**              | DeepSeek V3, R1          | Cost-effective alternative              |
| **OpenRouter**            | 100+ models              | Single API, any model                   |
| **Together AI**           | Open-source models       | Fine-tuning support                     |
| **Ollama**                | Any GGUF model           | Fully offline, local-only               |
| **LM Studio**             | Any local model          | Desktop GUI + API server                |
| **vLLM**                  | Any HuggingFace model    | Self-hosted, GPU-optimized              |
| **Any OpenAI-compatible** | —                        | Custom endpoints welcome                |

> **Air-gapped environments?** Run CyberStrike entirely offline with Ollama or LM Studio. No data leaves your machine — ever.

### What Makes It Different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Specialized Security Agents, Not Generic Chat**

CyberStrike ships with 13+ agents purpose-built for security domains. Each agent carries domain-specific methodology, tool knowledge, and testing patterns. The web-application agent follows OWASP WSTG. The cloud-security agent knows CIS benchmarks. The mobile agent uses Frida and follows MASTG/MASVS. They don't guess — they follow proven offensive security frameworks.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Intelligence Layer, Not Just an LLM Wrapper**

Most AI security tools are thin wrappers that send your prompt to an API. CyberStrike's intelligence layer normalizes outputs across 15+ providers, guards context between test phases, auto-detects your provider configuration, and orchestrates multi-step attack chains. The result: consistent, methodology-driven pentesting regardless of which model you use.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Any LLM, Zero Lock-in**

Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Amazon Bedrock, Azure, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Together AI — or run fully offline with Ollama and LM Studio. You choose the model. You own the results. As AI models get better and cheaper, CyberStrike gets better with them. Switch providers in seconds without reconfiguring anything.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Remote Tool Execution with Bolt**

Your security tools don't have to run on your laptop. Deploy Bolt on one or many remote servers, pair with Ed25519 keys, and control everything from your local terminal. One CyberStrike instance can orchestrate dozens of Bolt servers — each with its own toolkit, network position, and attack surface access.

### Agents

Switch between agents with `Tab`. Each one is a domain specialist.

| Agent                  | Focus   | What It Does                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **cyberstrike**        | General | Full-access primary agent — reconnaissance, exploitation, reporting |
| **web-application**    | Web     | OWASP Top 10, WSTG methodology, API security, session testing       |
| **mobile-application** | Mobile  | Android/iOS, Frida/Objection, MASTG/MASVS compliance                |
| **cloud-security**     | Cloud   | AWS, Azure, GCP — IAM misconfigs, CIS benchmarks, exposed resources |
| **internal-network**   | Network | Active Directory, Kerberos attacks, lateral movement, pivoting      |

Plus **8 specialized proxy testers** that run automatically on intercepted traffic:

| Tester                   | What It Tests                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDOR**                 | Object-level access control — can user A reach user B's resources?           |
| **Authorization Bypass** | Vertical privilege escalation — can low-privilege users hit admin endpoints? |
| **Mass Assignment**      | Unexpected writable fields — role, price, balance, userId in request bodies  |
| **Injection**            | SQL, command, LDAP, template injection across all input vectors              |
| **Authentication**       | Token validation, session fixation, credential exposure                      |
| **Business Logic**       | Price manipulation, coupon reuse, race conditions, workflow bypass           |
| **SSRF**                 | Internal host access via user-controlled URLs or redirect parameters         |
| **File Attacks**         | Path traversal, unrestricted upload, dangerous file types                    |

Each tester uses a **3-gate confirmation protocol**: execute a baseline request, execute the attack, compare responses. A finding is only reported when there is a measurable, reproducible difference — not on speculation. Duplicate findings (same endpoint + attack vector) are automatically suppressed across the session.

---

### HackBrowser

> Full documentation: **[docs.cyberstrike.io/docs/tools/hacker-browser](https://docs.cyberstrike.io/docs/tools/hacker-browser/)**

HackBrowser is CyberStrike's built-in Chromium browser. Start it from the TUI with `/hackbrowser`. As you browse, every HTTP request is captured and routed through the proxy-agent pipeline — no manual export, no Burp project files.

**Two capture modes:**

- **Manual** — Browse the target yourself. Log in as different users, navigate features, trigger actions. HackBrowser captures the real API traffic behind every click.
- **Autonomous** — Provide credentials for multiple accounts, set a scope, and let HackBrowser crawl automatically. It logs in as each user, maps reachable pages, and captures the traffic difference between roles.

**Role & credential discovery:**

As you browse with multiple accounts, CyberStrike builds a session context — a live map of discovered credentials, inferred role hierarchy, and which endpoints each role can reach. The 8 proxy sub-testers use this context directly: they know which token to use for a high-privilege baseline and which lower-privilege credentials to test with, without any manual setup.

```
Browser traffic → Proxy intercept → Orchestrator → 8 sub-testers (parallel)
                                          ↓
                               Session context (credentials, roles,
                               endpoints, functions) shared across all testers
```

**Scope control:**

Use `--scope` to limit testing to specific domains. CyberStrike automatically derives the registered domain (e.g. `--scope api.example.com` covers `api.example.com` but not `other.com`). Pass multiple `--scope` flags for multi-domain targets.

---

### Web UI & Remote Access

CyberStrike includes a full web interface. Run `cyberstrike web` and control your agents, MCP servers, Bolt connections, and vulnerability findings from any browser.

**Access from anywhere with Cloudflare Tunnel:**

```
Browser ──HTTPS──▶ Cloudflare Tunnel ──encrypted──▶ cloudflared (localhost) ──▶ CyberStrike Server
```

```bash
export CYBERSTRIKE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
cyberstrike web
# In another terminal:
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4096 run your-tunnel
```

**Why this is secure:**

- **Zero open ports** — CyberStrike binds to `localhost:4096`. `cloudflared` makes an outbound-only connection to Cloudflare's edge. No firewall rules, no port forwarding needed.
- **End-to-end encryption** — Browser to Cloudflare edge is TLS. Cloudflare edge to your machine is an encrypted tunnel. No plaintext leaves your network.
- **Password-protected API** — Every API request requires Basic Auth. Local requests on `localhost` bypass auth for convenience; remote requests via CF tunnel always require credentials (detects `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP`).
- **Your data stays local** — LLM inference runs on your hardware. CyberStrike processes everything locally. The tunnel is just a secure pipe.

**What's in the Web UI:**

| Tab                 | What It Does                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Chat**            | Full conversation with all 13+ security agents                                 |
| **MCP**             | Live MCP server status, health, and tool counts                                |
| **Bolt**            | Bolt remote server connection monitoring                                       |
| **Vulnerabilities** | Discovered vulns with severity, PoC, and impact                                |
| **Web Context**     | Endpoints, roles, credentials, and functions discovered during active sessions |

**[app.cyberstrike.io](https://app.cyberstrike.io)** is a hosted static page (no backend, no data storage) for convenience. Or self-host: clone the repo and serve `packages/app/dist/` from your own domain.

### Bolt — Remote Tool Execution

Bolt is CyberStrike's remote tool server. Deploy it on any VPS, cloud instance, or Docker container — then control it from your local terminal over MCP protocol with Ed25519 authentication.

**One CyberStrike, many Bolt servers:**

```
                                          ┌─────────────────────┐
                                     ┌───►│  Bolt Server #1     │
                                     │    │  nmap, nuclei, ffuf  │
┌──────────────────┐   MCP + Ed25519 │    └─────────────────────┘
│  Your Terminal   │   over HTTPS    │    ┌─────────────────────┐
│  CyberStrike TUI │ ◄─────────────►├───►│  Bolt Server #2     │

└──────────────────┘                 │    └─────────────────────┘
                                     │    ┌─────────────────────┐
                                     └───►│  Bolt Server #3     │
                                          │  Custom toolkit      │
                                          └─────────────────────┘
```

- **Deploy anywhere** — VPS, Docker, Kubernetes, or bare metal with pre-built Kali images
- **Ed25519 key pairing** — No passwords, no shared secrets, no attack surface
- **Real-time streaming** — Results flow back to your TUI as they happen
- **Manage from TUI** — Add, remove, and monitor Bolt servers without leaving CyberStrike
- **Scale horizontally** — Run heavy scans from servers with better bandwidth while you work locally
