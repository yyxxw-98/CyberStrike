// Hackbrowser tool — agent-callable wrapper around the hackbrowser library.
// All cyberstrike→hackbrowser plumbing (Provider, Server URL, log bridge,
// re-entrance) lives in hackbrowser-launcher.ts; this file is just the
// Tool.define surface (parameters, permission gate, output shape).
//
// Surface is shared with the /hackbrowser slash command and the
// `cyberstrike hackbrowser` CLI subcommand — same fields, same semantics
// across all three entry points.

const DESCRIPTION = `Crawl a web application autonomously and capture HTTP requests with UI context.

Use this when you have a target URL but no captured requests yet — hackbrowser will navigate the app, fill forms, click buttons, and stream every HTTP request into the current session for later vulnerability analysis. After captures arrive, the proxy-analyzer ingest pipeline analyzes them automatically.

This tool runs ASYNCHRONOUSLY: it returns immediately after starting the background crawl. Captures stream into the session over the next 30s–2min. Do NOT call this tool again to "wait" for results — use web_get_session_context to inspect captured endpoints when you actually need them. The hackbrowser status (running / completed / failed) appears in the TUI sidebar.

Defaults to anonymous headless mode. To crawl as authenticated user(s), pass \`credentials\` — the browser opens visibly and the user must log in manually before the crawl begins. Each credential ID in the array triggers its own login + crawl cycle, so multiple IDs run a sequence (role-based access tests). Auto-login (filling username/password in code) is intentionally not supported. Only invoke with credentials when a human is present to complete each login interactively; without a user, the crawl will hang at the login step.`
