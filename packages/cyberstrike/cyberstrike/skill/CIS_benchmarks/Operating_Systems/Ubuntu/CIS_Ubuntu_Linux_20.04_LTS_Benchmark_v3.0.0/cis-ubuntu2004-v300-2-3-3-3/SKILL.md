# Ensure chrony is enabled and running

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and is designed to synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly accurate.

chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.

More information on chrony can be found at: http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/.

**Note:**

- If systemd-timesyncd is being used, chrony should be removed and this section skipped
- Only one time synchronization method should be in use on the system

## Audit

- IF - chrony is in use on the system, run the following commands:

Run the following command to verify chrony is enabled:

### Command Line

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled chrony.service
```

**Output:**

```
enabled
```

Run the following command to verify chrony is running:

```bash
# systemctl is-active chrony.service
```

**Output:**

```
active
```

## Remediation

- IF - chrony is in use on the system, run the following commands:

Run the following command to unmask chrony.service:

### Command Line

```bash
# systemctl unmask chrony.service
```

Run the following command to enable and start chrony.service:

```bash
# systemctl --now enable chrony.service
```

**- OR -**

If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove chrony from the system:

```bash
# apt purge chrony
# apt autoremove chrony
```
