# Ensure ftp client is not installed

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The ftp package contains the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client, which allows users to transfer files to and from remote systems using FTP.

## Rationale

The FTP protocol is insecure and uses unencrypted protocols for communication.

## Impact

Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional misuse.

## Audit

Verify ftp is not installed. The following command may provide the needed information:

### Command Line

```bash
# dpkg-query -s ftp &>/dev/null && echo "ftp is installed"
```

## Expected Result

Nothing should be returned.

## Remediation

Uninstall ftp:

### Command Line

```bash
# apt purge ftp
```
