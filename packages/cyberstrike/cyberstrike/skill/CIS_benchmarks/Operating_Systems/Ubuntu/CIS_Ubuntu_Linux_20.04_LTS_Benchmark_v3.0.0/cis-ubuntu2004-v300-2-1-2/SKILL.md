# 2.1.2 Ensure avahi daemon services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

## Description

Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration.

## Rationale

Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the remote attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify avahi-daemon is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' avahi-daemon
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# systemctl is-active avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
```

Verify the services are not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

avahi-daemon should not be installed, or if installed, the services should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge avahi-daemon:

```bash
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# systemctl mask avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# apt purge avahi-daemon
```

## Default Value

avahi-daemon is installed by default on desktop installations.
