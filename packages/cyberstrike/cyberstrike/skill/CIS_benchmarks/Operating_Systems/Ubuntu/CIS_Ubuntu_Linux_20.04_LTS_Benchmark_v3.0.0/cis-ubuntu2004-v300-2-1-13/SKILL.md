# 2.1.13 Ensure rsync services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The rsync service can be used to synchronize files between systems over network links.

## Rationale

The rsync service presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication. Unless there is a need to run rsync as a daemon, it is recommended that the rsync service be disabled to reduce the remote attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify rsync is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' rsync
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled rsync.service
# systemctl is-active rsync.service
```

Verify the service is not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

rsync should not be installed as a service, or if installed, the service should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge rsync:

```bash
# systemctl stop rsync.service
# systemctl mask rsync.service
# apt purge rsync
```

## Default Value

rsync may be installed but the daemon is not enabled by default.
