## Description

The talk software makes it possible for users to send and receive messages across systems through a terminal session. The talk client, which allows initialization of talk sessions, is installed by the talk package.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify talk is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' talk
```

Verify talk is not installed.

## Expected Result

talk package should not be installed.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to remove talk:

```bash
# apt purge talk
```

## Default Value

talk is not installed by default.
