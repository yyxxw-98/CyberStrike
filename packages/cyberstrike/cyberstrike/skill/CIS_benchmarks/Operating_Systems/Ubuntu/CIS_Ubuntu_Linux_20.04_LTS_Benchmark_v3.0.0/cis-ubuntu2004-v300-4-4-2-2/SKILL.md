# CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v3.0.0 - Control 4.4.2.2

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8).

Note:

- Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system
- Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well

## Rationale

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to the operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network (127.0.0.0/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an anti-spoofing measure.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following commands and verify output includes the listed rules in order (`pkts` and `bytes` counts may differ, `prot` may be `all` or `0`):

```bash
iptables -L INPUT -v -n
```

```
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
    0     0 DROP       all  --  *      *       127.0.0.0/8          0.0.0.0/0
```

```bash
iptables -L OUTPUT -v -n
```

```
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  *      lo      0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```

## Expected Result

INPUT chain accepts loopback traffic and drops traffic from 127.0.0.0/8. OUTPUT chain accepts outbound loopback traffic.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
```

## Default Value

Not applicable.
