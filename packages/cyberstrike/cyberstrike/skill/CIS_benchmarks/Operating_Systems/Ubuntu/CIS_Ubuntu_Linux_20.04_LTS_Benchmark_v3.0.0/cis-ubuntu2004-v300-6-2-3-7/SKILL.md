# 6.2.3.7 Ensure rsyslog is not configured to receive logs from a remote client (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

`rsyslog` supports the ability to receive messages from remote hosts, thus acting as a log server. Clients should not receive data from other hosts.

## Rationale

If a client is configured to also receive data, thus turning it into a server, the client system is acting outside its operational boundary.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Unless the system's primary function is to serve as a logfile server, run the following script to review the `rsyslog` configuration and verify that the system is not configured to accept incoming logs.

advanced format:

```bash
# grep -P -- '^\h*module\(load="imtcp"\)|^\h*input\(type="imtcp" port="514"\)' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
# grep -P -- '^\h*module\(load="imudp"\)|^\h*input\(type="imudp" port="514"\)' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
```

No output expected.

obsolete legacy format:

```bash
# grep  -P -- '(^\$ModLoad imtcp|^\$InputTCPServerRun)' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
# grep  -P -- '(^\$ModLoad imudp|^\$UDPServerRun)' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
```

## Expected Result

No output expected for any of the above commands.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Unless the system's primary function is to serve as a logfile server, modify the files returned by the Audit Procedure and remove the specific lines highlighted by the audit.
Verify none of the following entries are present in the `rsyslog` configuration.

advanced format:

```
# module(load="imtcp")
# input(type="imtcp" port="514")
# module(load="imudp")
# input(type="imudp" port="514")
```

Note: `obsolete legacy` - previously known as the legacy format. This format is obsolete and should not be used when writing new configurations. It was aimed at small additions to the original `sysklogd` format and has been replaced due to its limitations.

Reload the service:

```bash
# systemctl reload-or-restart rsyslog
```

## Default Value

Not configured to receive remote logs by default.
