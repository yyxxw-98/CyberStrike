# 2.1.7 Ensure ldap server services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central database.

## Rationale

If the system will not need to act as an LDAP server, it is recommended that the software be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify slapd is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' slapd
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled slapd.service
# systemctl is-active slapd.service
```

Verify the service is not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

slapd should not be installed, or if installed, the service should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge slapd:

```bash
# systemctl stop slapd.service
# systemctl mask slapd.service
# apt purge slapd
```

## Default Value

slapd is not installed by default.
