# 1.5.5 Ensure Automatic Error Reporting is not enabled (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The Apport Error Reporting Service automatically generates crash reports for debugging.

## Rationale

Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other private material.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify that the Apport Error Reporting Service is not enabled:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s apport &> /dev/null && grep -Psi -- '^\h*enabled\h*=\h*[^0]\b' /etc/default/apport
```

Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify that the apport service is not active:

```bash
# systemctl is-active apport.service | grep '^active'
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output should be returned for either command, confirming Apport is disabled and the service is not active.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit `/etc/default/apport` and add or edit the enabled parameter to equal `0`:

```
enabled=0
```

Run the following commands to stop and mask the apport service:

```bash
# systemctl stop apport.service
# systemctl mask apport.service
```

- OR -

Run the following command to remove the apport package:

```bash
# apt purge apport
```

## Default Value

enabled=1
