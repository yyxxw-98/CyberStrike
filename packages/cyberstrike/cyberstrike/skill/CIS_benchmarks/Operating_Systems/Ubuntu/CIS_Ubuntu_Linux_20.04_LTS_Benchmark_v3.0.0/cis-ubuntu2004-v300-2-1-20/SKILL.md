# 2.1.20 Ensure X window server services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 2 - Server

## Description

The X Window System provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is typically used on workstations where users login, but not on servers where users typically do not login.

## Rationale

Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows, remove it to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify xserver-common is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' xserver-common
```

Verify xserver-common is not installed.

## Expected Result

xserver-common should not be installed on server systems.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to remove xserver-common:

```bash
# apt purge xserver-common
```

## Default Value

xserver-common is installed on desktop installations, not on server installations.
