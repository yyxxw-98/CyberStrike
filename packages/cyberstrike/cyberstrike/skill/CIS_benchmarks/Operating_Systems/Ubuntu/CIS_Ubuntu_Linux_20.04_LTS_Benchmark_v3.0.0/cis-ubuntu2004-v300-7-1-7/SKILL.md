# 7.1.7 Ensure access to /etc/gshadow is configured (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/gshadow` file is used to store the information about groups that is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information.

## Rationale

If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/gshadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/gshadow` file (such as group administrators) could also be useful to subvert the group.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `/etc/gshadow` is mode 640 or more restrictive, `Uid` is `0/root` and `Gid` is `0/root` or `{GID}/shadow`:

```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/gshadow
```

Example:

```
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 42/ shadow)
```

## Expected Result

Mode 640 or more restrictive, Uid 0/root, Gid 0/root or {GID}/shadow.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run one of the following commands to set ownership of `/etc/gshadow` to `root` and group to either `root` or `shadow`:

```bash
# chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow
  -OR-
# chown root:root /etc/gshadow
```

Run the following command to remove excess permissions from `/etc/gshadow`:

```bash
# chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/gshadow
```

## Default Value

Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 42/ shadow)
