# Ensure sshd PermitEmptyPasswords is disabled (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `PermitEmptyPasswords` parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts with empty password strings.

## Rationale

Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the probability of unauthorized access to the system.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `PermitEmptyPasswords` is set to `no`:

```bash
# sshd -T | grep permitemptypasswords
```

```
permitemptypasswords no
```

- IF - `Match` set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the `-T` extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block.
  Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user _sshuser_:

```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep permitemptypasswords
```

Note: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are `addr` (source address), `user` (user), `host` (resolved source host name), `laddr` (local address), `lport` (local port number), and `rdomain` (routing domain)

## Expected Result

```
permitemptypasswords no
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set the `PermitEmptyPasswords` parameter to `no` above any `Include` and `Match` entries as follows:

```
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence, `Match` set statements withstanding. If `Include` locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in `Include` location.

## Default Value

PermitEmptyPasswords no

## CIS Controls

v8 - 5.2 Use Unique Passwords
Use unique passwords for all enterprise assets. Best practice implementation includes, at a minimum, an 8-character password for accounts using MFA and a 14-character password for accounts not using MFA.

v7 - 4.4 Use Unique Passwords
Where multi-factor authentication is not supported (such as local administrator, root, or service accounts), accounts will use passwords that are unique to that system.
