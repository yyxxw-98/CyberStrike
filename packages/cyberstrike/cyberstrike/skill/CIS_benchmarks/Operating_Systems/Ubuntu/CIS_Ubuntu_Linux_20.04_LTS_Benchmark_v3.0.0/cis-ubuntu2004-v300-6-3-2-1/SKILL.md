# 6.3.2.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

## Description

Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it will be rotated and a new log file will be started.

## Rationale

It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact the system and audit data is not lost.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:

```bash
# grep -Po -- '^\h*max_log_file\h*=\h*\d+\b' /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file = <MB>
```

## Expected Result

The `max_log_file` parameter should be set in accordance with site policy.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Set the following parameter in `/etc/audit/auditd.conf` in accordance with site policy:

```
max_log_file = <MB>
```

## Default Value

`max_log_file = 8`

## References

1. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5: AU-8

Additional Information: The `max_log_file` parameter is measured in megabytes. Other methods of log rotation may be appropriate based on site policy. One example is time-based rotation strategies which don't have native support in auditd configurations. Manual audit of custom configurations should be evaluated for effectiveness and completeness.
