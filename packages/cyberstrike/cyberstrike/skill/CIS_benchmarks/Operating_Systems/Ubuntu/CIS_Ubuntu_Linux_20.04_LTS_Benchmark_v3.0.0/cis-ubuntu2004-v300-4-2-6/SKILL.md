# CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v3.0.0 - Control 4.2.6

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Configure the firewall rules for new outbound connections.

Note:

- Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system
- Unlike iptables, when a new outbound rule is added, ufw automatically takes care of associated established connections, so no rules for the latter kind are required.

## Rationale

If rules are not in place for new outbound connections all packets will be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound connections match site policy:

```bash
ufw status numbered
```

## Expected Result

Output should show rules that match site policy for outbound connections.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Configure ufw in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement a policy to allow all outbound connections on all interfaces:

```bash
ufw allow out on all
```

## Default Value

Not applicable.
