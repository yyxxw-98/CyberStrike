# 1.3.1.3 Ensure all AppArmor Profiles are not disabled (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.

## Rationale

Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is intended to ensure that any policies that exist on the system are activated.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that profiles are loaded, and are in either enforce or complain mode:

```bash
# apparmor_status | grep profiles
```

Review output and ensure that profiles are loaded, and in either enforce or complain mode:

```
37 profiles are loaded.
35 profiles are in enforce mode.
2 profiles are in complain mode.
4 processes have profiles defined.
```

Run the following command and verify no processes are unconfined:

```bash
# apparmor_status | grep processes
```

Review the output and ensure no processes are unconfined:

```
4 processes have profiles defined.
4 processes are in enforce mode.
0 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
```

## Expected Result

- Profiles should be loaded and in either enforce or complain mode
- No processes should be unconfined

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to set all profiles to enforce mode:

```bash
# aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
```

- OR -

Run the following command to set all profiles to complain mode:

```bash
# aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*
```

Note: Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated for them and then be restarted.
