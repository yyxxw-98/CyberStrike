# 6.3.1.3 Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

## Description

Configure `grub2` so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if they start up prior to `auditd` startup.

## Rationale

Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to `auditd`, so that potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command:

```bash
# find /boot -type f -name 'grub.cfg' -exec grep -Ph -- '^\h*linux' {} + | grep -v 'audit=1'
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output should be returned, confirming that `audit=1` is set on all kernel lines.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add `audit=1` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`:

Example:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"
```

Run the following command to update the `grub2` configuration:

```bash
# update-grub
```

## Default Value

Not set by default.
