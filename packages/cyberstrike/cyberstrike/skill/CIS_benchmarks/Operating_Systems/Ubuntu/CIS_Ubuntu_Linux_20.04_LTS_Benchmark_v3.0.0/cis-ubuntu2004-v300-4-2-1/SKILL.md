# CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v3.0.0 - Control 4.2.1

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface for manipulating the firewall

## Rationale

A firewall utility is required to configure the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables or nftables back-end.

The Linux kernel's netfilter framework host-based firewall can protect against threats originating from within a corporate network to include malicious mobile code and poorly configured software on a host.

Note: Only one firewall utility should be installed and configured. UFW is dependent on the iptables package

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify that Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is installed:

```bash
dpkg-query -s ufw &>/dev/null && echo "ufw is installed"
```

## Expected Result

```
ufw is installed
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to install Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW):

```bash
apt install ufw
```

## Default Value

Not applicable.
