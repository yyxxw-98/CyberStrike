# CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v3.0.0 - Control 4.3.4

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Tables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies to packets of this family. Tables can have one of five families.

## Rationale

nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being built, nftables will not filter network traffic.

## Impact

Adding rules to a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity to the system

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify that a nftables table exists:

```bash
nft list tables
```

Return should include a list of nftables:
Example:

```
table inet filter
```

## Expected Result

A list of nftables tables is returned (e.g., `table inet filter`).

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to create a table in nftables

```bash
nft create table inet <table name>
```

Example:

```bash
nft create table inet filter
```

## Default Value

Not applicable.
