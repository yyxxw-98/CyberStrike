# Ensure sshd MaxAuthTries is configured (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `MaxAuthTries` parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the `syslog` file detailing the login failure.

## Rationale

Setting the `MaxAuthTries` parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number based on site policy.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that `MaxAuthTries` is `4` or less:

```bash
# sshd -T | grep maxauthtries
```

```
maxauthtries 4
```

- IF - `Match` set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the `-T` extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block.
  Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user _sshuser_:

```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep maxauthtries
```

Note: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are `addr` (source address), `user` (user), `host` (resolved source host name), `laddr` (local address), `lport` (local port number), and `rdomain` (routing domain).

## Expected Result

```
maxauthtries 4
```

(or a value of 4 or less)

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the `MaxAuthTries` parameter to `4` or less above any `Include` and `Match` entries as follows:

```
MaxAuthTries 4
```

Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence, `Match` set statements withstanding. If `Include` locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in `Include` location.

## Default Value

MaxAuthTries 6
