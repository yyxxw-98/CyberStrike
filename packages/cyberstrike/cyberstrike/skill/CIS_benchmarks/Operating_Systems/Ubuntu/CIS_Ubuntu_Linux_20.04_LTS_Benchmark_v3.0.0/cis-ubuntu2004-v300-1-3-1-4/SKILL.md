# 1.3.1.4 Ensure all AppArmor Profiles are enforcing (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

## Description

AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.

## Rationale

Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is intended to ensure that any policies that exist on the system are activated.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following commands and verify that profiles are loaded and are not in complain mode:

```bash
# apparmor_status | grep profiles
```

Review output and ensure that profiles are loaded, and in enforce mode:

```
34 profiles are loaded.
34 profiles are in enforce mode.
0 profiles are in complain mode.
2 processes have profiles defined.
```

Run the following command and verify that no processes are unconfined:

```bash
apparmor_status | grep processes
```

Review the output and ensure no processes are unconfined:

```
2 processes have profiles defined.
2 processes are in enforce mode.
0 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
```

## Expected Result

- All profiles should be in enforce mode with 0 profiles in complain mode
- No processes should be unconfined

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to set all profiles to enforce mode:

```bash
# aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
```

Note: Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated for them and then be restarted.
