# 5.3.3.2.1 Ensure password number of changed characters is configured (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `pwquality difok` option sets the number of characters in a password that must not be present in the old password.

## Rationale

Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify that the `difok` option is set to `2` or more and follows local site policy:

```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*difok\h*=\h*([2-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:

```
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwdifok.conf:difok = 2
```

Verify returned value(s) are `2` or more and meet local site policy.

Run the following command to verify that `difok` is not set, is `2` or more, and conforms to local site policy:

```bash
grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?difok\h*=\h*([0-1])\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

Nothing should be returned.

Note:

- settings should be configured in only one location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
  - module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file
  - settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory
  - settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Create or modify a file ending in `.conf` in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory or the file `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` and add or modify the following line to set `difok` to `2` or more. Ensure setting conforms to local site policy:

Example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

{
  sed -ri 's/^\s*difok\s*=/#  &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
  [ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
  printf '\n%s' "difok = 2" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwdifok.conf
}
```

Run the following command:

```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?difok\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the `difok` argument from the `pam_pwquality.so` line(s).

## Default Value

difok = 1
