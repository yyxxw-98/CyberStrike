# 2.1.16 Ensure tftp server services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple protocol for exchanging files between two TCP/IP machines. TFTP servers allow connections from a TFTP Client for sending and receiving files.

## Rationale

TFTP does not support authentication nor does it ensure the confidentiality or integrity of data. It is recommended that TFTP be removed, unless there is a specific need for TFTP. In that case, extreme caution should be used when configuring the services.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify tftpd-hpa is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' tftpd-hpa
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled tftpd-hpa.service
# systemctl is-active tftpd-hpa.service
```

Verify the service is not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

tftpd-hpa should not be installed, or if installed, the service should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge tftpd-hpa:

```bash
# systemctl stop tftpd-hpa.service
# systemctl mask tftpd-hpa.service
# apt purge tftpd-hpa
```

## Default Value

tftpd-hpa is not installed by default.
