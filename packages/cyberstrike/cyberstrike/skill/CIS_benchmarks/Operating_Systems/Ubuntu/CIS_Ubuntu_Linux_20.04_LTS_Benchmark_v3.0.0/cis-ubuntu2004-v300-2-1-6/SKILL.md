# 2.1.6 Ensure ftp server services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a traditional and widely used standard tool for transferring files between a server and clients over a network, especially where no authentication is necessary (permits anonymous users to connect to a server).

## Rationale

FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials. It is recommended SFTP be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need to run the system as an FTP server, it is recommended that the service be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify vsftpd is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' vsftpd
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled vsftpd.service
# systemctl is-active vsftpd.service
```

Verify the service is not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

vsftpd should not be installed, or if installed, the service should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge vsftpd:

```bash
# systemctl stop vsftpd.service
# systemctl mask vsftpd.service
# apt purge vsftpd
```

## Default Value

vsftpd is not installed by default.
