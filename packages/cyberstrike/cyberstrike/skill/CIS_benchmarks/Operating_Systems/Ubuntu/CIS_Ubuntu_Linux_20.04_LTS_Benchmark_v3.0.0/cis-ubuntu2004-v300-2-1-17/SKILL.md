# 2.1.17 Ensure web proxy server services are not in use (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Squid is a standard proxy server used in many distributions and environments.

## Rationale

If there is no need for a proxy server, it is recommended that the squid proxy software be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify squid is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' squid
```

If installed, run:

```bash
# systemctl is-enabled squid.service
# systemctl is-active squid.service
```

Verify the service is not enabled and not active.

## Expected Result

squid should not be installed, or if installed, the service should be stopped and masked.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to stop, mask, and purge squid:

```bash
# systemctl stop squid.service
# systemctl mask squid.service
# apt purge squid
```

## Default Value

squid is not installed by default.
