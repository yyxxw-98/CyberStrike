# Ensure sshd MACs are configured (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.

Notes:

- Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved MACs.
- Ensure that MACs used are in compliance with site policy.
- The only "strong" MACs currently FIPS 140 approved are:
  - HMAC-SHA1
  - HMAC-SHA2-256
  - HMAC-SHA2-384
  - HMAC-SHA2-512

## Rationale

MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify none of the "weak" MACs are being used:

```bash
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- 'macs\h+([^#\n\r]+,)?(hmac-md5|hmac-md5-96|hmac-ripemd160|hmac-sha1-96|umac-64@openssh\.com|hmac-md5-etm@openssh\.com|hmac-md5-96-etm@openssh\.com|hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh\.com|hmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh\.com|umac-64-etm@openssh\.com|umac-128-etm@openssh\.com)\b'
```

Nothing should be returned.
Note: Review CVE-2023-48795 and verify the system has been patched. If the system has not been patched, review the use of the Encrypt Then Mac (etm) MACs.
The following are considered "weak" MACs, and should not be used:

```
hmac-md5
hmac-md5-96
hmac-ripemd160
hmac-sha1-96
umac-64@openssh.com
hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com
hmac-md5-96-etm@openssh.com
hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com
hmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh.com
umac-64-etm@openssh.com
umac-128-etm@openssh.com
```

## Expected Result

Nothing should be returned (no weak MACs in use).

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and add/modify the `MACs` line to contain a comma separated list of the site unapproved (weak) MACs preceded with a `-` above any `Include` entries:
Example:

```
MACs -hmac-md5,hmac-md5-96,hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,umac-64@openssh.com,hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com,hmac-md5-96-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh.com,umac-64-etm@openssh.com
```

- IF - CVE-2023-48795 has not been reviewed and addressed, the following `etm` MACs should be added to the exclude list: hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
  Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location.

## Default Value

MACs umac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1
