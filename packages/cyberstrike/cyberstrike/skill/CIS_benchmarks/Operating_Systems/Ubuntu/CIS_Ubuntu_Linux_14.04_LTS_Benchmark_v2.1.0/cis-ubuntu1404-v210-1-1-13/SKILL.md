# 1.1.13 Ensure nodev option set on /home partition (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

## Rationale

Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
mount | grep /home
# Verify that the nodev option is set on /home
# Expected output: /dev/xvdf1 on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,relatime,data=ordered)
```

## Expected Result

The output should show the `nodev` option is set for the /home partition.

## Remediation

```bash
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /home partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

# Run the following command to remount /home:
mount -o remount,nodev /home
```

## Default Value

By default, the nodev option is not set on /home.

## Notes

The actions in this recommendation refer to the /home partition, which is the default user partition that is defined in many distributions. If you have created other user partitions, it is recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as well.
