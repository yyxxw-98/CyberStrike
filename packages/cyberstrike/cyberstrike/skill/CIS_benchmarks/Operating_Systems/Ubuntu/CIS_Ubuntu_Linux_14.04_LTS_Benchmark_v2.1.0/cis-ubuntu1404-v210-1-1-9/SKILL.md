# 1.1.9 Ensure noexec option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.

## Rationale

Since the /var/tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /var/tmp.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
mount | grep /var/tmp
# Verify that the noexec option is set on /var/tmp
# Expected output: tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
```

## Expected Result

The output should show the `noexec` option is set for the /var/tmp partition.

## Remediation

```bash
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /var/tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

# Run the following command to remount /var/tmp:
mount -o remount,noexec /var/tmp
```

## Default Value

By default, the noexec option is not set on /var/tmp.
