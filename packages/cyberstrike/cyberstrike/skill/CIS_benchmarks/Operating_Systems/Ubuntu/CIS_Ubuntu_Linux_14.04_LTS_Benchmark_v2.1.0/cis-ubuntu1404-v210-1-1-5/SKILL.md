# 1.1.5 Ensure separate partition exists for /var (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

## Description

The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.

## Rationale

Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
mount | grep /var
# Expected output: /dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
```

## Expected Result

Verify output shows /var is mounted on a separate partition.

## Remediation

```bash
# For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup
# and specify a separate partition for /var.
# For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
# configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
```

## Default Value

By default, /var is not mounted on a separate partition.
