# 1.1.3 Ensure nodev option set on /tmp partition (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

## Rationale

Since the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /tmp.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
mount | grep /tmp
# Verify that the nodev option is set on /tmp
# Expected output: tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
```

## Expected Result

The output should show the `nodev` option is set for the /tmp partition.

## Remediation

```bash
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

# Run the following command to remount /tmp:
mount -o remount,nodev /tmp
```

## Default Value

By default, the nodev option is not set on /tmp.

## Notes

systemd includes the tmp.mount service which should be used instead of configuring /etc/fstab. Mounting options are configured in the Options setting in /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount.

## Profile

- Level 1
