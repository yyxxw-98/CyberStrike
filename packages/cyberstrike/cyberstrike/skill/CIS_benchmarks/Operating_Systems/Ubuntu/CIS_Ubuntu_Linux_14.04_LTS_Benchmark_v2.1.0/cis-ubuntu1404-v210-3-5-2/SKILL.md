# 3.5.2 Ensure SCTP is disabled (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.

## Rationale

If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

```bash
modprobe -n -v sctp
# Expected: install /bin/true

lsmod | grep sctp
# Expected: <No output>
```

## Expected Result

```
install /bin/true
```

And no output from `lsmod | grep sctp`.

## Remediation

Edit or create the file `/etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf` and add the following line:

```
install sctp /bin/true
```

## Default Value

Not disabled by default.
