# 1.1.18 Ensure nosuid option set on removable media partitions (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.

## Rationale

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
# Run the following command and verify that the nosuid option is set on all
# removable media partitions:
mount
```

## Expected Result

All removable media partitions should have the `nosuid` option set.

## Remediation

```bash
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options)
# of all removable media partitions. Look for entries that have mount points
# that contain words such as floppy or cdrom.
# See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
```

## Default Value

By default, the nosuid option is not set on removable media partitions.
