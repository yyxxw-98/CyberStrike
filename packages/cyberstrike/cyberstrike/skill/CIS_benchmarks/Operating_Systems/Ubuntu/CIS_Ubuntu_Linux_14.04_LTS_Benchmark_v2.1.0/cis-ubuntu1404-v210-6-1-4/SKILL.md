# 6.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/group are configured (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/group` file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else.

## Rationale

The `/etc/group` file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged programs.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644`:

```bash
stat /etc/group
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Remediation

Run the following command to set permissions on `/etc/group`:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/group
chmod 644 /etc/group
```

## Default Value

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)

## References
