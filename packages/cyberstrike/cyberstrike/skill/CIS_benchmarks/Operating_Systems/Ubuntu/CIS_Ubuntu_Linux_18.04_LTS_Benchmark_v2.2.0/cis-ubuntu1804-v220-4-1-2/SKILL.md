# CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.2.0 - Control 4.1.2

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/crontab` file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can access the file.

## Rationale

This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` does not grant permissions to `group` or `other`:

```bash
stat -c "%a %U %G" /etc/crontab
```

### Expected Result

```
600 root root
```

OR more restrictive.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on `/etc/crontab`:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/crontab
chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab
```

## Default Value

Access: (0600/-rw-------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
