# 5.1.1.1.4 Ensure journald is not configured to receive logs from a remote client (Automated)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Journald supports the ability to receive messages from remote hosts, thus acting as a log server. Clients should not receive data from other hosts.

Note:

- The same package, `systemd-journal-remote`, is used for both sending logs to remote hosts and receiving incoming logs.
- With regards to receiving logs, there are two services; `systemd-journal-remote.socket` and `systemd-journal-remote.service`.

## Rationale

If a client is configured to also receive data, thus turning it into a server, the client system is acting outside it's operational boundary.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `systemd-journal-remote.socket` is not enabled:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled systemd-journal-remote.socket
```

Verify the output matches:

```
disabled
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `disabled`.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to disable `systemd-journal-remote.socket`:

```bash
systemctl --now disable systemd-journal-remote.socket
```

## Default Value

systemd-journal-remote.socket is disabled by default.
