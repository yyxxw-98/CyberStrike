# 1.4.2 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for unlocking boot options.

## Rationale

Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `0600` or more restrictive:

```bash
stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0600/-r--------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to set permissions on your grub configuration:

```bash
chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg
chmod u-x,go-rwx /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Additional Information

This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

Replace `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment.
