# 5.1.2.3 Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog (Manual)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Data from `journald` may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of `journald` logs, however, use of the RSyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export.

## Rationale

IF RSyslog is the preferred method for capturing logs, all logs of the system should be sent to it for further processing.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

IF RSyslog is the preferred method for capturing logs, review `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` and verify that logs are forwarded to `rsyslog`:

```bash
grep ^\s*ForwardToSyslog /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Verify the output matches:

```
ForwardToSyslog=yes
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `ForwardToSyslog=yes`.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and add the following line:

```
ForwardToSyslog=yes
```

Restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart rsyslog
```

## Default Value

ForwardToSyslog is not set by default.
