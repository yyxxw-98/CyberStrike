# 5.1.1.1.2 Ensure systemd-journal-remote is configured (Manual)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Journald (via `systemd-journal-remote`) supports the ability to send log events it gathers to a remote log host or to receive messages from remote hosts, thus enabling centralised log management.

## Rationale

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Verify `systemd-journal-remote` is configured. Run the following command:

```bash
grep -P "^ *URL=|^ *ServerKeyFile=|^ *ServerCertificateFile=|^ *TrustedCertificateFile=" /etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf
```

Verify the output matches per your environments certificate locations and the URL of the log server. Example:

```
URL=192.168.50.42
ServerKeyFile=/etc/ssl/private/journal-upload.pem
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/certs/journal-upload.pem
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/ca/trusted.pem
```

## Expected Result

Output should show URL, ServerKeyFile, ServerCertificateFile, and TrustedCertificateFile configured per your environment.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf` file and ensure the following lines are set per your environment:

```
URL=192.168.50.42
ServerKeyFile=/etc/ssl/private/journal-upload.pem
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/certs/journal-upload.pem
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/ca/trusted.pem
```

Restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart systemd-journal-upload
```

## Default Value

systemd-journal-remote is not configured by default.
