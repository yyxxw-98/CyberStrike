# 5.1.1.2 Ensure journald service is enabled (Automated)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Ensure that the `systemd-journald` service is enabled to allow capturing of logging events.

## Rationale

If the `systemd-journald` service is not enabled to start on boot, the system will not capture logging events.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `systemd-journald` is enabled:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled systemd-journald.service
```

Verify the output matches:

```
static
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `static`.

## Remediation

### Command Line

By default the `systemd-journald` service does not have an `[Install]` section and thus cannot be enabled / disabled. It is meant to be referenced as `Requires` or `Wants` by other unit files. As such, if the status of `systemd-journald` is not `static`, investigate why.

## Default Value

static
