# 5.1.3 Ensure all logfiles have appropriate access configured (Automated)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Log files stored in `/var/log/` contain logged information from many services on the system, or on log hosts others as well.

## Rationale

It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected. Access to the log files should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following script to verify that log files have appropriate permissions and ownership. Note: The script checks that log files are not world-readable, world-writable, or world-executable, and are owned by root or a system account.

```bash
find /var/log -type f -perm /g+wx,o+rwx -exec ls -l {} +
```

## Expected Result

No files should be returned, indicating all log files have appropriate permissions.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to remove inappropriate permissions from log files:

```bash
find /var/log -type f -exec chmod g-wx,o-rwx {} +
```

## Default Value

Permissions vary by log file and distribution defaults.
