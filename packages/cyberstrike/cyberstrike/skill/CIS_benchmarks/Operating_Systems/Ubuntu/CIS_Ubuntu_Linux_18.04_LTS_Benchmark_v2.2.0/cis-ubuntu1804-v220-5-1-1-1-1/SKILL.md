# 5.1.1.1.1 Ensure systemd-journal-remote is installed (Automated)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Journald (via `systemd-journal-remote`) supports the ability to send log events it gathers to a remote log host or to receive messages from remote hosts, thus enabling centralised log management.

## Rationale

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `systemd-journal-remote` is installed:

```bash
dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\t${Status}\t${db:Status-Status}\n' systemd-journal-remote
```

## Expected Result

```
systemd-journal-remote    install ok installed    installed
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to install `systemd-journal-remote`:

```bash
apt install systemd-journal-remote
```

## Default Value

systemd-journal-remote is not installed by default.
