# 5.1.1.5 Ensure journald is not configured to send logs to rsyslog (Manual)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Data from `journald` should be kept in the confines of the service and not forwarded on to other services.

## Rationale

IF journald is the method for capturing logs, all logs of the system should be handled by journald and not forwarded to other logging mechanisms.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

IF journald is the method for capturing logs, run the following command to verify that logs are not forwarded to `rsyslog`:

```bash
grep -Psi '^\h*ForwardToSyslog\h*=\h*yes\b' /etc/systemd/journald.conf /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/*
```

Verify that there is no output.

## Expected Result

No output should be returned.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and files in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/` and ensure that `ForwardToSyslog=yes` is removed.

Restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

## Default Value

ForwardToSyslog is not set by default.
