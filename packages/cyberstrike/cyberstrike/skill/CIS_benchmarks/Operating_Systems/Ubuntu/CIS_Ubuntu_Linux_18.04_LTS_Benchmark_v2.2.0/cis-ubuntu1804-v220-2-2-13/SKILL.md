# 2.2.13 Ensure SNMP Server is not installed (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs.

Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6.

Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.

## Rationale

The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the SNMP service is not required, the snmpd package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system.

Note: If SNMP is required:

- The server should be configured for `SNMP v3` only. `User Authentication` and `Message Encryption` should be configured.
- If `SNMP v2` is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `snmpd` is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s snmpd &>/dev/null && echo "snmpd is installed"
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output (empty result).

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to remove `snmpd`:

```bash
# apt purge snmpd
```
