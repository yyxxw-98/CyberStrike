# CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.2.0

## Control 5.2.1.3 - Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled (Automated)

### Profile Applicability

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

### Description

Configure grub2 so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if they start up prior to auditd startup.

### Rationale

Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.

### Audit

Run the following command:

```bash
find /boot -type f -name 'grub.cfg' -exec grep -Ph -- '^\h*linux\b' {} + | grep -v 'audit=1'
```

**Expected Output:**
Nothing should be returned.

### Remediation

Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add `audit=1` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`:

**Example:**

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"
```

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

```bash
update-grub
```

### Additional Information

This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

### CIS Controls

- v8 8.2 Collect Audit Logs - Collect audit logs. Ensure that logging, per the enterprise's audit log management process, has been enabled across enterprise assets.
- v7 6.2 Activate audit logging - Ensure that local logging has been enabled on all systems and networking devices.
