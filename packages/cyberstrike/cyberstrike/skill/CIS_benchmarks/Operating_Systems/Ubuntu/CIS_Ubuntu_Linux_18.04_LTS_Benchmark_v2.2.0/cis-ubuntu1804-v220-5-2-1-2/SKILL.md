# CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.2.0

## Control 5.2.1.2 - Ensure auditd service is enabled and active (Automated)

### Profile Applicability

- Level 2 - Server
- Level 2 - Workstation

### Description

Turn on the auditd daemon to record system events.

### Rationale

The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.

### Audit

Run the following command to verify auditd is enabled:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled auditd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
enabled
```

Verify result is "enabled".

Run the following command to verify auditd is active:

```bash
systemctl is-active auditd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
active
```

Verify result is "active".

### Remediation

Run the following command to enable and start auditd:

```bash
systemctl --now enable auditd
```
