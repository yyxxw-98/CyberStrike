# 5.1.1.7 Ensure journald default file permissions configured (Manual)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Journald will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls what permissions will be applied to these newly created files.

## Rationale

It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

First see if there is an override file `/etc/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf`. If so, this file will override all default settings as defined in `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf` and should be inspected.

If there is no override file, inspect the default `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf` against the site specific requirements.

Ensure that file permissions are `0640`. Should a site policy dictate less restrictive permissions, ensure to follow said policy. NOTE: More restrictive permissions such as `0600` is implicitly sufficient.

## Expected Result

File permissions should be `0640` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

### Command Line

If the default configuration is not appropriate for the site specific requirements, copy `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf` to `/etc/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf` and modify as required. Requirements is either `0640` or site policy if that is less restrictive.

## Default Value

0640
