# 5.1.1.4 Ensure journald is configured to write logfiles to persistent disk (Automated)

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Logs in memory will be lost upon a system reboot. By persisting logs to local disk on the server they are protected from loss due to a reboot.

## Rationale

Writing log data to disk will provide the ability to forensically reconstruct events which may have impacted the operations or security of a system even after a system crash or reboot.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify that logs are persisted to disk:

```bash
grep -Psi '^\h*Storage\h*=\h*persistent\b' /etc/systemd/journald.conf /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/*
```

Verify the output matches:

```
Storage=persistent
```

## Expected Result

The output should include `Storage=persistent`.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file or a file ending in `.conf` in /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/ and add the following line:

```
Storage=persistent
```

Restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

## Default Value

Storage=auto
