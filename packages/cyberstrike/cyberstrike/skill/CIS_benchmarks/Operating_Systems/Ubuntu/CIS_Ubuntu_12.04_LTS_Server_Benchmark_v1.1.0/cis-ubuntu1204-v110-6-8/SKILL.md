# 6.8 Ensure DNS Server is not enabled (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system that maps names to IP addresses for computers, services and other resources connected to a network.

## Rationale

Unless a server is specifically designated to act as a DNS server, it is recommended that the package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Run the following to ensure no start links for `bind9` exist in `/etc/rc*.d`:

```bash
ls /etc/rc*.d/S*bind9
```

## Expected Result

No results should be returned.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Remove any start links for `bind9` from `/etc/rc*.d`:

```bash
rm /etc/rc*.d/S*bind9
```

## Default Value

Not installed by default on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server.
