# 5.1.5 Ensure talk client is not installed (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `talk` software makes it possible for users to send and receive messages across systems through a terminal session. The `talk` client (allows initialization of talk sessions) is installed by default.

## Rationale

The software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Run the following command:

```bash
dpkg -s talk
```

## Expected Result

Ensure package status is not-installed or dpkg returns no info is available.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Uninstall the `talk` package:

```bash
apt-get purge talk
```

## Default Value

Installed by default on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server.
