# 2.25 Disable Automounting (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

`autofs` allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.

## Rationale

With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have it's contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Ensure no start conditions listed for `autofs`:

```bash
initctl show-config autofs autofs
```

## Expected Result

No start conditions should be listed for `autofs`. The service should be disabled or not installed.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Remove or comment out start lines in `/etc/init/autofs.conf`:

```
#start on runlevel [2345]
```

## Default Value

By default, `autofs` may be installed and enabled on Ubuntu 12.04.
