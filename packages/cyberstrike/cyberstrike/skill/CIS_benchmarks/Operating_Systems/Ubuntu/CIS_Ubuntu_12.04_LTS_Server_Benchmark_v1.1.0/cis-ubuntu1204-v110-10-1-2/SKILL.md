# 10.1.2 Set Password Change Minimum Number of Days (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `PASS_MIN_DAYS` parameter in `/etc/login.defs` allows an administrator to prevent users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that `PASS_MIN_DAYS` parameter be set to 7 or more days.

## Rationale

By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

```bash
grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs
# Expected output: PASS_MIN_DAYS 7

chage --list <user>
# Verify: Minimum number of days between password change: 7
```

## Expected Result

`PASS_MIN_DAYS` is set to 7 or more in `/etc/login.defs`, and all active users have a minimum password age of 7 days or more.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Set the `PASS_MIN_DAYS` parameter to 7 in `/etc/login.defs`:

```bash
# Edit /etc/login.defs and set:
PASS_MIN_DAYS 7

# Modify active user parameters to match:
chage --mindays 7 <user>
```

## Default Value

PASS_MIN_DAYS 0
