# 2.4 Set noexec option for /tmp Partition (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `noexec` mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.

## Rationale

Since the `/tmp` filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from `/tmp`.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

```bash
grep /tmp /etc/fstab | grep noexec
mount | grep /tmp | grep noexec
```

## Expected Result

Both commands should return output showing `noexec` is set. If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add `noexec` to the fourth field (mounting options). See the `fstab(5)` manual page for more information.

```bash
mount -o remount,noexec /tmp
```

## Default Value

By default, the `noexec` option is not set on the `/tmp` partition.
