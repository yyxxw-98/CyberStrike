# 8.1.3 Enable Auditing for Processes That Start Prior to auditd (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

Configure `grub` or `lilo` so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if they start up prior to `auditd` startup.

## Rationale

Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to `auditd`, so that potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` is configured to log processes that start prior to `auditd`.

```bash
grep "linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Make sure each line that starts with linux has the `audit=1` parameter set.

## Expected Result

Each linux boot line should contain `audit=1`.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Edit `/etc/default/grub` to include `audit=1` as part of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"
```

And run the following command to update the grub configuration:

```bash
update-grub
```

## Default Value

By default, auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is not enabled.
