# 2.17 Set Sticky Bit on All World-Writable Directories (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.

## Rationale

This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories (such as `/tmp`) that are owned by another user.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

```bash
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned. If any directories are listed, the sticky bit is not set on them.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

```bash
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d -perm -0002 2>/dev/null | xargs chmod a+t
```

## Default Value

By default, the sticky bit is set on `/tmp` but may not be set on other world-writable directories.
