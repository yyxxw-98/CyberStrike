# 9.2.1 Set Password Creation Requirement Parameters Using pam_cracklib (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `pam_cracklib` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the `pam_cracklib.so` options:

- `retry=3` - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
- `minlen=14` - password must be 14 characters or more
- `dcredit=-1` - provide at least one digit
- `ucredit=-1` - provide at least one uppercase character
- `ocredit=-1` - provide at least one special character
- `lcredit=-1` - provide at least one lowercase character

The setting shown above is one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.

## Rationale

Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine the current settings in the `/etc/pam.d/common-password` file:

```bash
grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

## Expected Result

```
password required pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=14 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Set the `pam_cracklib.so` parameters as follows in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`:

```bash
password required pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=14 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1
```

## Default Value

No password creation requirements are set by default.
