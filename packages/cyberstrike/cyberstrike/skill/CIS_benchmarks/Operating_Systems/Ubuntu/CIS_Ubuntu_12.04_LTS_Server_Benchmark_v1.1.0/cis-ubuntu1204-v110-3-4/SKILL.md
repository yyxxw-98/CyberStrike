# 3.4 Require Authentication for Single-User Mode (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Setting a password for the `root` user will force authentication in single user mode.

## Rationale

Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized user from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if a password is set for the `root` user:

```bash
grep ^root:[*\!]: /etc/shadow
```

## Expected Result

No results should be returned. If a result is returned, the root account does not have a password set.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Run the following command and follow the prompts to set a password for the `root` user:

```bash
passwd root
```

## Default Value

By default, the root account may or may not have a password set depending on installation choices.
