# 8.2.1 Install the rsyslog package (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `rsyslog` package is a third party package that provides many enhancements to syslog, such as multi-threading, TCP communication, message filtering and data base support.

## Rationale

The security enhancements of rsyslog such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Ensure `rsyslog` is installed:

```bash
dpkg -s rsyslog
```

## Expected Result

Ensure package status is `installed ok installed`.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Install the `rsyslog` package:

```bash
apt-get install rsyslog
```

## Default Value

rsyslog is not installed by default on all Ubuntu 12.04 installations.
