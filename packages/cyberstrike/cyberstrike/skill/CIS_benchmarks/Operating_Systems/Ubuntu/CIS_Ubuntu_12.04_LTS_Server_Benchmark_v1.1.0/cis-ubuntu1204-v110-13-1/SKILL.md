# 13.1 Ensure Password Fields are Not Empty (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user without providing a password.

## Rationale

All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:

```bash
/bin/cat /etc/shadow | /usr/bin/awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a password "}'
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned. If any accounts are listed, they have empty password fields.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

If any accounts in the `/etc/shadow` file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:

```bash
/usr/bin/passwd -l <username>
```

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off.

## Default Value

By default, all accounts created with `useradd` or `adduser` require a password to be set.
