# 8.1.7 Record Events That Modify the System's Mandatory Access Controls (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

Monitor SELinux mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor any write access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or attribute changes to the `/etc/selinux/` directory.

## Rationale

Changes to files in this directory could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting to modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the system.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if events that modify the system's mandatory access controls are recorded:

```bash
grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules
```

## Expected Result

```
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Add the following lines to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy
# Execute the following command to restart auditd
# pkill -P 1-HUP auditd
```

## Default Value

By default, mandatory access control modification events are not audited.
