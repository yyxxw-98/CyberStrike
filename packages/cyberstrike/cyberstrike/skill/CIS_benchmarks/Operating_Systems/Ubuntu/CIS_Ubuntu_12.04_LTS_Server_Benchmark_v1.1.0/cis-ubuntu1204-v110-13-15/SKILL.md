# 13.15 Check for Duplicate GIDs (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Although the `groupadd` program will not let you create a duplicate Group ID (GID), it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the `/etc/group` file and change the GID field.

## Rationale

User groups must be assigned unique GIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate access protections.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

This script checks to make sure all GIDs in the `/etc/group` file are unique. You can also use the `/usr/sbin/grpck` command to check for other inconsistencies in the `/etc/group` file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/cat /etc/group | /usr/bin/cut -f3 -d":" | /usr/bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/uniq -c |\
while read x ; do
    [ -z "${x}" ] && break
    set - $x
    if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then
        grps=`/usr/bin/awk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$2 \
            /etc/group | xargs`
        echo "Duplicate GID ($2): ${grps}"
    fi
done
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned. Any output indicates duplicate GIDs exist in `/etc/group`.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Based on the results of the script, establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by the shared GID to determine which group they are supposed to belong to.

## Default Value

The `groupadd` command assigns unique GIDs by default.
