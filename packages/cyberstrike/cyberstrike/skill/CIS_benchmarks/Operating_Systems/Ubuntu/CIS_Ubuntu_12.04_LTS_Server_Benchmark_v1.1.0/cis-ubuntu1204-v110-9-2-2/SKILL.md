# 9.2.2 Set Lockout for Failed Password Attempts (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Lock out users after _n_ unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are made to the PAM configuration file `/etc/pam.d/login`. The second set of changes are applied to the program specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM.

Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site.

## Rationale

Locking out userIDs after _n_ unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force password attacks against your systems.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine the current settings for user lockout:

```bash
grep "pam_tally2" /etc/pam.d/login
```

## Expected Result

```
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Edit the `/etc/pam.d/login` file and add the auth line below:

```bash
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900
```

**Note:** If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by `deny=` in the `pam_tally2.so` module, the user can be unlocked by issuing the command `/sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset`. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.

## Default Value

No account lockout is configured by default.
