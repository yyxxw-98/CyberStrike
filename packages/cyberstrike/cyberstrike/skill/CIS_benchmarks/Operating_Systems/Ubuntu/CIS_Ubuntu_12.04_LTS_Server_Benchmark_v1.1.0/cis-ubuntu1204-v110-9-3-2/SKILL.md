# 9.3.2 Set LogLevel to INFO (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `INFO` parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged.

## Rationale

SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. `DEBUG` is specifically _not_ recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. `INFO` level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is as shown:

```bash
grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

## Expected Result

```
LogLevel INFO
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameter as follows:

```bash
LogLevel INFO
```

## Default Value

LogLevel INFO
