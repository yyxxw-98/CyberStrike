# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 6.2.17

## Profile

- **Level:** 1 - Server
- **Level:** 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

## Rationale

Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/shadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:

```bash
grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
```

```bash
awk -F: -v GID="$(awk -F: '($1=="shadow") {print $3}' /etc/group)" '($4==GID) {print}' /etc/passwd
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned from either command.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group.

## Default Value

N/A

## References

N/A
