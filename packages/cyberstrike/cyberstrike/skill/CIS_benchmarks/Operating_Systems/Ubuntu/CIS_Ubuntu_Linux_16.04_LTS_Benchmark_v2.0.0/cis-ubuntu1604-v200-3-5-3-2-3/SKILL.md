# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 3.5.3.2.3

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Configure the firewall rules for new outbound, and established connections.

Notes:

- Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.
- Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.

## Rationale

If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound, and established connections match site policy:

```bash
iptables -L -v -n
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Configure iptables in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement a policy to allow all outbound connections and all established connections:

```bash
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```
