# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - 6.1.2

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/passwd` file contains user account information that is used by many system utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate.

## Rationale

It is critical to ensure that the `/etc/passwd` file is protected from unauthorized write access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644`:

```bash
stat /etc/passwd
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to set permissions on `/etc/passwd`:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/passwd
chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/passwd
```

## Default Value

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
