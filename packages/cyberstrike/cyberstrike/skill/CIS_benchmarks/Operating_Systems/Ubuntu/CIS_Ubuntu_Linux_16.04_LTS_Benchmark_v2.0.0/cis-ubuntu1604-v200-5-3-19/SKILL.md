# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 5.3.19

## Description

The `Banner` parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.

## Rationale

Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

```bash
sshd -T -C user=root -C host="$(hostname)" -C addr="$(grep $(hostname) /etc/hosts | awk '{print $1}')" | grep banner
```

### Expected Result

```
banner /etc/issue.net
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameter as follows:

```
Banner /etc/issue.net
```
