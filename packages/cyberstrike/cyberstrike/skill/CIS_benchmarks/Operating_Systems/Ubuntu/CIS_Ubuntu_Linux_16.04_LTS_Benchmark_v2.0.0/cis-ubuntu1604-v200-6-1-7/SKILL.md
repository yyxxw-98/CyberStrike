# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - 6.1.7

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The `/etc/shadow-` file is used to store backup information about user accounts that is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information.

## Rationale

It is critical to ensure that the `/etc/shadow-` file is protected from unauthorized access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify `Uid` is `0/root`, `Gid` is `0/root` or `<gid>/shadow`, and `Access` is `640` or more restrictive:

```bash
stat /etc/shadow-
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (   42/  shadow)
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run **one** of the following commands to set ownership of `/etc/shadow-` to `root` and group to either `root` or `shadow`:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/shadow-
chown root:shadow /etc/shadow-
```

Run the following command to remove excess permissions from `/etc/shadow-`:

```bash
chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/shadow-
```

## Default Value

Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 42/ shadow)
