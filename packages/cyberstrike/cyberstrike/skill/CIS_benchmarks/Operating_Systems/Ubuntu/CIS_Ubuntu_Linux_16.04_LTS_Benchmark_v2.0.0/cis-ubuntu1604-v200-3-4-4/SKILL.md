# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 3.4.4

## Description

The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to provide communication between cluster nodes.

## Rationale

If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

```bash
modprobe -n -v tipc | grep -E '(tipc|install)'
```

```bash
lsmod | grep tipc
```

## Expected Result

```
install /bin/true
```

The `lsmod` command should return no output.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit or create a file in the `/etc/modprobe.d/` directory ending in `.conf`

Example: `vi /etc/modprobe.d/tipc.conf`

and add the following line:

```
install tipc /bin/true
```

## Default Value

TIPC module is available but typically not loaded by default.
