# Ensure all users last password change date is in the past

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

**Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

All users should have a password change date in the past.

## Rationale

If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set password expiration.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify nothing is returned:

```bash
awk -F : '/^[^:]+:[^!*]/{print $1}' /etc/shadow | while read -r usr; do [ "$(date --date="$(chage --list "$usr" | grep '^Last password change' | cut -d: -f2)" +%s)" -gt "$(date "+%s")" ] && echo "user: $usr password change date: $(chage --list "$usr" | grep '^Last password change' | cut -d: -f2)"; done
```

**Expected Result:**

Nothing should be returned.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Investigate any users with a password change date in the future and correct them. Locking the account, expiring the password, or resetting the password manually may be appropriate.
