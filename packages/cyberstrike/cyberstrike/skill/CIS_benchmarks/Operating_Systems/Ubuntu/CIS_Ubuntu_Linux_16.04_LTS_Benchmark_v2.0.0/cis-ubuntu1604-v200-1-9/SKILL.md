# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - 1.9

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality.

## Rationale

Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
apt -s upgrade

## Expected Result

## Remediation

### Command Line

```bash

```

OR

```bash
apt dist-upgrade
```

## Default Value
