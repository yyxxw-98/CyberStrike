## Profile

- **Level:** 2 - Server
- **Level:** 2 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

auditd is the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's responsible for writing audit records to the disk.

## Rationale

The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify auditd is installed:

```bash
dpkg -s auditd audispd-plugins
```

## Expected Result

The command should return package status information for both `auditd` and `audispd-plugins`, indicating they are installed.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to install auditd:

```bash
apt install auditd audispd-plugins
```

## Default Value

auditd is not installed by default.
