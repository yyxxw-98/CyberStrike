# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 3.5.1.7

## Profile

- **Level:** Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

A default deny policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will be rejected.

Note: Any port or protocol without a explicit allow before the default deny will be blocked.

## Rationale

With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

## Impact

Any port and protocol not explicitly allowed will be blocked. The following rules should be considered before applying the default deny:

```
ufw allow git
ufw allow in http
ufw allow in https
ufw allow out 53
ufw logging on
```

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that the default policy for **incoming**, **outgoing**, and **routed** directions is **deny** or **reject**:

```bash
ufw status verbose
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to implement a default deny policy:

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default deny outgoing
ufw default deny routed
```

## References

None
