# Ensure root login is restricted to system console

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

**Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

The file `/etc/securetty` contains a list of valid terminals that may be logged in directly as root.

## Rationale

Since the system console has special properties to handle emergency situations, it is important to ensure that the console is in a physically secure location and that unauthorized consoles have not been defined.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

```bash
cat /etc/securetty
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Remove entries for any consoles that are not in a physically secure location.

## References

None
