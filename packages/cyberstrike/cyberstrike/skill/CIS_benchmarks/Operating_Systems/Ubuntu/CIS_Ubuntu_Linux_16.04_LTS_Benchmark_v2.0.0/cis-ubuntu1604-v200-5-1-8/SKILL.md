# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - 5.1.8

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Configure `/etc/cron.allow` to allow specific users to use this service. If `/etc/cron.allow` does not exist, then `/etc/cron.deny` is checked. Any user not specifically defined in this file is allowed to use cron. By removing the file, only users in `/etc/cron.allow` are allowed to use cron.

Notes:

- Other methods, such as `systemd timers`, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, `cron` should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy
- Even though a given user is not listed in `cron.allow`, cron jobs can still be run as that user
- The `cron.allow` file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs

## Rationale

On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule `cron` jobs. Using the `cron.allow` file to control who can run `cron` jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that `/etc/cron.deny` does not exist:

```bash
stat /etc/cron.deny
```

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access`, does not grant write or execute to group, and does not grant permissions to `other` for `/etc/cron.allow`:

```bash
stat /etc/cron.allow
```

## Expected Result

The first command should return:

```
stat: cannot stat '/etc/cron.deny': No such file or directory
```

The second command should return:

```
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)  Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to remove `/etc/cron.deny`:

```bash
rm /etc/cron.deny
```

Run the following command to create `/etc/cron.allow`:

```bash
touch /etc/cron.allow
```

Run the following commands to set permissions and ownership for `/etc/cron.allow`:

```bash
chmod g-wx,o-rwx /etc/cron.allow
chown root:root /etc/cron.allow
```

## Default Value

By default, `/etc/cron.deny` exists and `/etc/cron.allow` does not exist.

## References

None.
