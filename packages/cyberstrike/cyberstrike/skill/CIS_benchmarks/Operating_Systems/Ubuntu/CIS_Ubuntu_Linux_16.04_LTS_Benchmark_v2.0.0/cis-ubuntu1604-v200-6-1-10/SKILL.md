# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - 6.1.10

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files are the least secure. See the `chmod(2)` man page for more information.

## Rationale

Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system. World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify no files are returned:

```bash
df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -perm -0002
```

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items on network mounted partitions. Additionally the `--local` option to `df` is not universal to all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:

```bash
find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -0002
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Removing write access for the "other" category (`chmod o-w <filename>`) is advisable, but always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given file.

## Default Value

Not applicable.
