# CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0 - Control 3.4.1

## Description

The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide in-sequence delivery.

## Rationale

If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

```bash
modprobe -n -v dccp
```

```bash
lsmod | grep dccp
```

## Expected Result

```
install /bin/true
```

The `lsmod` command should return no output.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Edit or create a file in the `/etc/modprobe.d/` directory ending in `.conf`

Example: `vi /etc/modprobe.d/dccp.conf`

Add the following line:

```
install dccp /bin/true
```

## Default Value

DCCP module is available but typically not loaded by default.
