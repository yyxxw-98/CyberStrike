# Ensure 'Python version' is currently supported (if in use)

## Description

Periodically, older versions of Python may be deprecated and no longer supported. Using a supported version of Python for function apps is recommended to avoid potential unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Rationale

Deprecated and unsupported versions of programming and scripting languages can present vulnerabilities which may not be addressed or may not be addressable.

## Impact

If your app is written using version-dependent features or libraries, they may not be available on more recent versions. If you wish to update, research the impact thoroughly.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
4. In the `General settings` pane, ensure that for a `Stack` of `Python`, the `Python Version` reflects a currently supported release.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each function app.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list function apps:

```bash
az functionapp list
```

For each function app, run the following command to get the Python version:

```bash
az functionapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query "{LinuxFxVersion:linuxFxVersion,PythonVersion:pythonVersion}"
```

If Python is in use, ensure the version is currently supported.

### Using Azure PowerShell

Run the following command to list function apps:

```powershell
Get-AzFunctionApp
```

Run the following command to get the function app in a resource group with a given name:

```powershell
$app = Get-AzFunctionApp -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <function-app-name>
```

Run the following command to get the Python version:

```powershell
$app.SiteConfig | Select-Object LinuxFXVersion, PythonVersion
```

If Python is in use, ensure the version is currently supported. Repeat for each function app.

Take note of the currently supported versions (given a status of "security") of Python here: https://devguide.python.org/versions/

## Expected Result

If Python is in use, the Python version should reflect a currently supported release.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
4. In the `General settings` pane, for a `Stack` of `Python`, set the `Python Version` to a currently supported release.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Click `Continue`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each function app requiring remediation.

**Note:** No action is required if Python is not in use.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list supported runtimes:

```bash
az functionapp list-runtimes
```

For each function app requiring remediation, run the following command with the appropriate parameters to update the Python version:

```bash
az functionapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --linux-fx-version "PYTHON|<version>"
```

## Default Value

The version is selected during creation.
