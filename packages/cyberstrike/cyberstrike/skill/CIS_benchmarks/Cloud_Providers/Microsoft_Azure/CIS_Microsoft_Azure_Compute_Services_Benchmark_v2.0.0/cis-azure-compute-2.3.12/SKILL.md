# Ensure managed identities are configured

## Description

Managed identities from Microsoft Entra ID allow function apps to securely access other Azure services without the need to provision or rotate any secrets.

## Rationale

Using managed identities with function apps eliminates the need to store and manage credentials to access Azure resources.

## Impact

Minor administrative overhead to configure and manage role assignments for managed identities.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Identity`.
4. Ensure that in the `System assigned` pane, the `Status` is set to `On`, and an `Object (principal) ID` is displayed, or that in the `User assigned` pane, a managed identity is listed.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each function app.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list function apps:

```bash
az functionapp list
```

For each function app, run the following command to get the identity setting:

```bash
az functionapp show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <function-app-name> --query "identity"
```

Ensure that `type` is set to `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, or both.

## Expected Result

The identity `type` should be set to `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, or both.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Identity`.
4. To add a system assigned managed identity:
   1. In the `System assigned` pane, under `Status`, click `On`.
   2. Click `Save`.
   3. Click `Yes`.
5. To add a user assigned managed identity:
   1. In the `User assigned` pane, click `Add`.
   2. Use the filter box to search for a managed identity.
   3. Select the identity.
   4. Click `Add`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each function app requiring remediation.

### Using Azure CLI

For each function app requiring remediation, run the following command to assign a system-assigned managed identity:

```bash
az functionapp identity assign --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <function-app-name>
```

### Using Azure PowerShell

For each function app requiring remediation, run the following command to assign a system-assigned managed identity:

```powershell
Update-AzFunctionApp -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <function-app-name> -IdentityType SystemAssigned -Force
```

## Default Value

Managed identities are disabled by default for function apps.
