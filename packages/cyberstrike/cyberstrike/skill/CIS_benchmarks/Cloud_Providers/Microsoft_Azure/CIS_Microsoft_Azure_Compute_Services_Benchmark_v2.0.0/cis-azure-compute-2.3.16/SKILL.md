# Ensure all traffic is routed through the virtual network

## Description

Enable `vnetRouteAllEnabled` to ensure all outbound traffic is routed through the integrated virtual network.

This recommendation should be applied after integrating a function app with a virtual network.

## Rationale

Routing all outbound traffic through the virtual network enhances security.

## Impact

Additional configuration may be required to ensure that traffic is routed properly.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Outbound traffic configuration`, next to `Virtual network integration`, click the virtual network and subnet name.
5. Under `Application routing`, ensure that the box next to `Outbound internet traffic` is checked.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each function app.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list function apps:

```bash
az functionapp list
```

For each function app, run the following command to get the virtual network traffic routing setting:

```bash
az functionapp show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query vnetRouteAllEnabled
```

Ensure that `true` is returned.

## Expected Result

The `vnetRouteAllEnabled` setting should return `true`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Outbound traffic configuration`, next to `Virtual network integration`, click the virtual network and subnet name.
5. Under `Application routing`, check the box next to `Outbound internet traffic`.
6. Click `Apply`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each function app requiring remediation.

### Using Azure CLI

For each function app requiring remediation, run the following command to route all traffic through the virtual network:

```bash
az resource update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <function-app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetRouteAllEnabled=true
```

## Default Value

For function apps integrated with a virtual network, all traffic is routed through the virtual network by default.
