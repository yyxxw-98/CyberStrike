# Ensure public network access is disabled

## Description

Disable public network access to prevent exposure to the internet and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Use private endpoints to securely manage access within trusted networks.

## Rationale

Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the service is not directly exposed to the public Internet. This has the added benefit of providing more granular control over security settings and configurations for those additional layers of separation.

## Impact

**NOTE:** Prior to disabling public network access, it is strongly recommended that, for each function app, either:

- complete virtual network integration as described in "Ensure app is integrated with a virtual network"

OR

- set up private endpoints/links as described in "Ensure private endpoints are used to access App Service apps."

Disabling public network access restricts direct access to the service. This enhances security but will require the configuration of a virtual network and/or private endpoints for any services or users needing access within trusted networks.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Inbound traffic configuration`, ensure that `Public network access` is set to `Disabled`.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each function app.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list function apps:

```bash
az functionapp list
```

For each function app, run the following command to get the public network access setting:

```bash
az functionapp show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <function-app-name> --query "publicNetworkAccess"
```

Ensure the command returns `"Disabled"`.

## Expected Result

The `publicNetworkAccess` setting should return `"Disabled"`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services` or `Function App`.
2. Click the name of a function app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Inbound traffic configuration`, click the text next to `Public network access`.
5. Select the radio button next to `Disabled`.
6. Click `Save`.
7. Check the box to confirm the change.
8. Click `Continue`.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each function app requiring remediation.

### Using Azure CLI

For each function app requiring remediation, run the following command to disable public network access:

```bash
az resource update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <function-app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.publicNetworkAccess=Disabled
```

## Default Value

By default, public network access is enabled.
