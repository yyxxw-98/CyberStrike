# Ensure App Service Environment is provisioned with v3 or higher

## Description

Ensure App Service Environment is provisioned with v3 or higher to benefit from the latest enhancements.

## Rationale

Older versions of App Service Environment require manual management of Azure resources and have greater scaling limitations.

## Impact

Manual configuration may be required to complete the migration and to optimize your App Service plan SKU choice to meet your needs.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Service Environments`.
2. Click the name of an App Service Environment.
3. Ensure that `Version` displays `App Service Environment v3` or higher.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each App Service Environment.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list App Service Environments:

```bash
az appservice ase list
```

For each App Service Environment, ensure that `kind` is set to `ASEV3` or higher.

## Expected Result

The `kind` property should be `ASEV3` or higher. The `Version` should display `App Service Environment v3`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

When creating an App Service Environment from the portal, after clicking `+ Add`, ensure that `Create App Service Environment v3` is displayed.

## Default Value

The default version is currently App Service Environment v3.

## Additional Information

App Service Environment v1 and v2 were retired as of 31 August, 2024. As of September 1, 2024, Azure auto-migrated any remaining App Service Environment v1 and v2 on a best-effort basis.
