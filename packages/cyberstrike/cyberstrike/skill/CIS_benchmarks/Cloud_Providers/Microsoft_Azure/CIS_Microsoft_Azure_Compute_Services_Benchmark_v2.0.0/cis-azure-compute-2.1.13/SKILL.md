# Ensure managed identities are configured

## Description

Managed identities from Microsoft Entra ID allow App Service apps to securely access other Azure services without the need to provision or rotate any secrets.

## Rationale

Using managed identities with App Service apps eliminates the need to store and manage credentials to access Azure resources.

## Impact

Minor administrative overhead to configure and manage role assignments for managed identities.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services`.
2. Click the name of an app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Identity`.
4. Ensure that in the `System assigned` pane, the `Status` is set to `On`, and an `Object (principal) ID` is displayed, or that in the `User assigned` pane, a managed identity is listed.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each app.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list web apps:

```
az webapp list
```

For each web app, run the following command:

```
az webapp identity show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query type
```

Ensure the command returns `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, or both.

### Using Azure PowerShell

Run the following command to list web apps:

```
Get-AzWebApp
```

Run the following command to get the web app in a resource group with a given name:

```
Get-AzWebapp -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <app-name>
```

Run the following command to get the assigned identity type for a web app:

```
$webapp.Identity.Type
```

Ensure the command returns `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, or both.

## Expected Result

The identity type should return `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, or both.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `App Services`.
2. Click the name of an app.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Identity`.
4. To add a system assigned managed identity:
   1. In the `System assigned` pane, under `Status`, click `On`.
   2. Click `Save`.
   3. Click `Yes`.
5. To add a user assigned managed identity:
   1. In the `User assigned` pane, click `Add`.
   2. Use the filter box to search for a managed identity.
   3. Select the identity.
   4. Click `Add`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each app requiring remediation.

### Using Azure CLI

For each web app requiring remediation, run the following command to assign a managed identity:

```
az webapp identity assign --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
```

### Using Azure PowerShell

For each web app requiring remediation, run the following command to assign a managed identity:

```
Set-AzWebApp -AssignIdentity $True -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <app-name>
```

## Default Value

Managed identities are disabled by default for App Service apps.
