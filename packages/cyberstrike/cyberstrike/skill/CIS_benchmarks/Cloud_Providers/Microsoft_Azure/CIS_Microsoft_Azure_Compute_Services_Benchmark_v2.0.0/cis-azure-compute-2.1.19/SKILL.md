# Ensure configuration is routed through the virtual network integration

## Description

By default, configuration traffic for App Service apps goes directly over the public route. Container image pulls and content sharing can be routed through the virtual network integration.

This recommendation should be applied after integrating an App Service app with a virtual network.

## Rationale

Route container image pulls and content sharing through a virtual network integration for increased security and control.

## Impact

Additional configuration may be required to ensure that traffic is routed properly.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list apps:

```
az webapp list
```

For each app, run the following command to get the container image share and content share settings:

```
az webapp show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query "[vnetImagePullEnabled,vnetContentShareEnabled]"
```

Ensure that `[true,true]` is returned.

### Using Azure Portal

Not specifically documented with portal-only steps for this control.

### Using Azure PowerShell

Not specifically documented for this control.

## Expected Result

Both `vnetImagePullEnabled` and `vnetContentShareEnabled` should return `true`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure CLI

For each app requiring remediation, run the following command to route container image pulls and content sharing through the virtual network integration:

```
az resource update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetImagePullEnabled=true --set properties.vnetContentShareEnabled=true
```

### Using Azure Portal

Not specifically documented with portal-only steps for this control.

### Using Azure PowerShell

Not specifically documented for this control.

## Default Value

By default, configuration traffic goes directly over the public route.

## Additional Information

In addition to configuring the routing for content sharing, you must also ensure that any firewall or Network Security Group configured on traffic from the subnet allow traffic to port 443 and 445.
