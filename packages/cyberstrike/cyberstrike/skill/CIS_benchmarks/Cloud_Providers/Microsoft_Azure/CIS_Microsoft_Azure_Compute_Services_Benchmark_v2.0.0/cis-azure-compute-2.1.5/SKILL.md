# Ensure 'FTP State' is set to 'FTPS only' or 'Disabled'

## Description

By default, App Service supports deployment over FTP. If FTP is essential for a deployment workflow, FTPS should be enforced for all App Service apps.

If FTPS is not explicitly required, the recommended setting is `Disabled`.

## Rationale

FTP is an unencrypted network protocol that transmits data -- including passwords -- in clear text. The use of this protocol can lead to both data and credential compromise and can present opportunities for exfiltration, persistence, and lateral movement.

## Impact

Deployment workflows that rely on FTP or FTPS rather than WebDeploy or HTTPS endpoints may be affected.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to the Azure Portal
2. Select `App Services`
3. Click on an app
4. Select `Settings` and then `Configuration`
5. Under `General Settings`, for the `Platform Settings`, the `FTP state` should not be set to `All allowed`

### Using Azure CLI

List webapps to obtain the ids:

```
az webapp list
```

List the publish profiles to obtain the username, password, and ftp server url:

```
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --ids <ids>
```

### Using Azure PowerShell

List all Web Apps:

```
Get-AzWebApp
```

For each app:

```
Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Name <app name> | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SiteConfig
```

In the output, look for the value of **FtpsState**. If its value is **AllAllowed** the setting is out of compliance. Any other value is considered in compliance with this check.

## Expected Result

FTP state should be set to `FtpsOnly` or `Disabled`, not `AllAllowed`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to the Azure Portal
2. Select `App Services`
3. Click on an app
4. Select `Settings` and then `Configuration`
5. Under `General Settings`, for the `Platform Settings`, the `FTP state` should be set to `Disabled` or `FTPS Only`

### Using Azure CLI

For each out of compliance application, run the following choosing either 'disabled' or 'FtpsOnly' as appropriate:

```
az webapp config set --resource-group <resource group name> --name <app name> --ftps-state [disabled|FtpsOnly]
```

### Using Azure PowerShell

For each out of compliance application, run the following:

```
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Name <app name> -FtpsState <Disabled or FtpsOnly>
```

## Default Value

By default, FTP state is set to `FTPS only`.
