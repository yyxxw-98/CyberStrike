# Ensure 'HTTP2' is set to 'Enabled' on Azure Application Gateway

## Description

Enable HTTP/2 for improved performance, efficiency, and security.

HTTP/2 protocol support is available to clients that connect to application gateway listeners only. Communication with backend server pools is always HTTP/1.1.

## Rationale

Enabling HTTP/2 supports use of modern encrypted connections.

## Impact

Clients and backend services that do not support HTTP/2 will fall back to HTTP/1.1.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. Go to `Application gateways`.
2. Click the name of an application gateway.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
4. Ensure `HTTP2` is set to `Enabled`.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each application gateway.

### Using Azure CLI

Run the following command to list application gateways:

```bash
az network application-gateway list
```

For each application gateway, run the following command to get the HTTP2 setting:

```bash
az network application-gateway show --resource-group <resource-group> --name <application-gateway> --query enableHttp2
```

Ensure `true` is returned.

### Using PowerShell

Run the following command to list application gateways:

```powershell
Get-AzApplicationGateway
```

Run the following command to get the application gateway in a resource group with a given name:

```powershell
$gateway = Get-AzApplicationGateway -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <application-gateway>
```

Run the following command to get the HTTP2 setting:

```powershell
$gateway.EnableHttp2
```

Ensure `True` is returned.

Repeat for each application gateway.

## Expected Result

All Application Gateways should have HTTP2 set to `Enabled` (enableHttp2 = true).

## Remediation

### Remediate from Azure Portal

1. Go to `Application gateways`.
2. Click the name of an application gateway.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
4. Under `HTTP2`, click `Enabled`.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each application gateway requiring remediation.

### Remediate from Azure CLI

For each application gateway requiring remediation, run the following command to enable HTTP2:

```bash
az network application-gateway update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <application-gateway> --http2 Enabled
```

### Remediate from PowerShell

Run the following command to get the application gateway in a resource group with a given name:

```powershell
$gateway = Get-AzApplicationGateway -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <application-gateway>
```

Run the following command to enable HTTP2:

```powershell
$gateway.EnableHttp2 = $true
```

Run the following command to apply the update:

```powershell
Set-AzApplicationGateway -ApplicationGateway $gateway
```

Repeat for each application gateway requiring remediation.

## Default Value

HTTP2 is enabled by default.
