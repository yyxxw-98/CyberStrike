# Ensure 'Users can register applications' is set to 'No'

## Description

Require administrators or appropriately delegated users to register third-party applications.

## Rationale

It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Microsoft Entra ID data. Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.

## Impact

Enforcing this setting will create additional requests for approval that will need to be addressed by an administrator. If permissions are delegated, a user may approve a malevolent third party application, potentially giving it access to your data.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Azure Portal

1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
2. Select `Microsoft Entra ID`
3. Under `Manage`, select `Users`
4. Under `Manage`, select `User settings`
5. Ensure that `Users can register applications` is set to `No`

### Using PowerShell

```powershell
(Get-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy).DefaultUserRolePermissions | Format-List AllowedToCreateApps
```

Command should return the value of `False`.

## Expected Result

`Users can register applications` should be set to `No`. PowerShell should return `AllowedToCreateApps: False`.

## Remediation

### Using Azure Portal

1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
2. Select `Microsoft Entra ID`
3. Under `Manage`, select `Users`
4. Under `Manage`, select `User settings`
5. Set `Users can register applications` to `No`
6. Click `Save`

### Using PowerShell

```powershell
$param = @{ AllowedToCreateApps = "$false" }
Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy -DefaultUserRolePermissions $param
```

## Default Value

By default, `Users can register applications` is set to "Yes".
