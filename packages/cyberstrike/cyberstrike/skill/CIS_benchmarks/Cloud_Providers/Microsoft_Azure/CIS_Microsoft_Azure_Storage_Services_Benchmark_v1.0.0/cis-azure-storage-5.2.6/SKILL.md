# 5.2.6 Ensure 'Cross Region Restore' is set to 'Enabled' on Recovery Services vaults (Automated)

## Description

Cross region restore enables data restoration in a secondary Azure paired region, even when the primary region is fully operational. This allows organizations to conduct drills and validate regional resiliency, thereby ensuring preparedness for potential outages.

## Rationale

Enabling cross region restore facilitates proactive resilience testing and disaster recovery planning by allowing data restoration drills in a secondary region without needing a primary region outage. This capability helps organizations validate recovery processes, identify gaps in regional failover, and ensures critical data can be accessed and restored during real disruptions.

## Impact

Enabling cross region restore on a Recovery Services vault incurs additional costs, and once it is enabled, it cannot be disabled.

- Cross region restore can only be enabled on Recovery Services vaults using the GRS replication type.
- Cross region restore is available for Azure Virtual Machines, SQL/SAP HANA databases running inside Azure VMs, and Recovery Services Agent (Preview) in the vault. There is no support for classic VMs.
- Cross region restore is currently an irreversible storage property.
- When cross region restore is enabled, Azure upgrades backup storage from GRS to read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS). Pricing is updated accordingly.

## Audit Procedure

### Audit from Azure Portal

1. Go to `Recovery Services vaults`.
2. Click the name of a Recovery Services vault.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Properties`.
4. Under `Backup Configuration`, click `Update`.
5. Next to `Cross Region Restore`, ensure the radio button next to `Enabled` is selected.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each Recovery Services vault.

### Audit from Azure CLI

Run the following command to list Recovery Services vaults:

```bash
az backup vault list
```

For each Recovery Services vault, run the following command:

```bash
az backup vault show --resource-group <resource-group> --name <recovery-services-vault>
```

Ensure that under `properties` > `redundancySettings`, `crossRegionRestore` is set to `Enabled`.

### Audit from PowerShell

Run the following command to list Recovery Services vaults:

```powershell
Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault
```

Run the following command to get the Recovery Services vault in a resource group with a given name:

```powershell
$vault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <recovery-services-vault>
```

Run the following command to get the cross region restore setting for the Recovery Services vault:

```powershell
$vault.Properties.RedundancySettings.CrossRegionRestore
```

Ensure that the command returns `Enabled`.
Repeat for each Recovery Services vault.

## Expected Result

- `properties.redundancySettings.crossRegionRestore` is set to `Enabled`
- In Azure Portal, the radio button next to `Enabled` is selected for `Cross Region Restore`
- PowerShell returns `Enabled` for `$vault.Properties.RedundancySettings.CrossRegionRestore`

## Remediation

### Remediate from Azure Portal

1. Go to `Recovery Services vaults`.
2. Click the name of a Recovery Services vault.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Properties`.
4. Under `Backup Configuration`, click `Update`.
5. Next to `Cross Region Restore`, select the radio button next to `Enabled`.
6. Click `Apply`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each Recovery Services vault requiring remediation.

### Remediate from Azure CLI

For each Recovery Services vault requiring remediation, run the following command to enable cross region restore:

```bash
az backup vault update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <recovery-services-vault> --cross-region-restore-flag Enabled
```

### Remediate from PowerShell

Run the following command to get the Recovery Services vault in a resource group with a given name:

```powershell
$vault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <recovery-services-vault>
```

Run the following command to enable cross region restore:

```powershell
Set-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProperty -Vault $vault -EnableCrossRegionRestore
```

Repeat for each Recovery Services vault requiring remediation.

## Default Value

Cross region restore is disabled by default on Recovery Services vaults.
