# 16.1 Ensure 'Allowed Protocols' for shared access signature (SAS) tokens is set to 'HTTPS Only' (Manual)

## Description

Shared access signatures (SAS) can be used to grant limited access to Azure Storage resources. When generating a SAS, it is possible to specify the allowed protocols for a request made with the SAS. It is recommended to allow requests over HTTPS only.

## Rationale

If a SAS is passed over HTTP and intercepted, an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can read the SAS. Then, they can use that SAS just as the intended user could have. This can potentially compromise sensitive data or allow for data corruption by the malicious user.

## Impact

SAS can pose security risks if they are not managed carefully.

## Audit Procedure

It is not possible to audit generated SAS.

## Expected Result

All shared access signature (SAS) tokens should be configured to allow only HTTPS protocol requests. The `Allowed protocols` setting should be set to `HTTPS only` when generating SAS tokens.

## Remediation

### Remediate from Azure Portal

If SAS have been created to allow HTTP and were created with a stored access policy (SAP), the SAS can be revoked by deleting the SAP or updating the SAP expiration time to a time in the past:

1. Go to `Storage accounts`.
2. Click on a storage account.
3. Under `Data storage`, click `Queues`.
4. Click the three dots next to a queue.
5. Click `Access policy`.
6. Click the three dots next to an access policy.
7. Click `Delete`.
8. Click `Save`.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 as needed to revoke SAS created with SAP.

If SAS have been created to allow HTTP and were not created with a SAP, the SAS can be revoked by regenerating the storage account access keys:

Note: Regenerating access keys can affect any applications or Azure services that are dependent on the storage account key.

1. Go to `Storage accounts`.
2. Click on a storage account.
3. Under `Security + networking`, click `Access keys`.
4. Next to each key, click `Rotate key`.
5. Click `Yes` to confirm.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 as needed to revoke SAS.

## Default Value

When generating a SAS, the default selection for `Allowed protocols` is `HTTPS only`.

## Additional Information

This recommendation is based on the recommendation `Ensure 'Allowed Protocols' for shared access signature (SAS) tokens is set to 'HTTPS Only'`, from the `Common Reference Recommendations > Secrets and Keys > Shared Access Signatures` section.
