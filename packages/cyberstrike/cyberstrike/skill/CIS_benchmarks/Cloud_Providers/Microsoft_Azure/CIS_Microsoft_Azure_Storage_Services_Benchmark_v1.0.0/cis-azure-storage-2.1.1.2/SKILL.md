# 2.1.1.2 Ensure that shared access signature (SAS) tokens expire within an hour (Manual)

## Description

Shared access signature (SAS) tokens provide restricted access to Azure Storage resources (such as blobs, files, queues, or tables) for a defined time period with specific permissions. It enables users to interact with the resources without exposing account keys, offering precise control over the permitted actions (e.g., read, write) and the duration of access. To minimize security risks, SAS tokens should be configured with the shortest possible lifespan, ideally lasting no longer than an hour.

## Rationale

A short lifespan for SAS tokens is recommended to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. SAS tokens grant time-limited access to resources, and a longer duration increases the opportunity for misuse if the token is compromised. By setting a shorter lifespan, the potential for security breaches is reduced.

## Impact

SAS can pose security risks if they are not managed carefully.

## Audit Procedure

This is a Common Reference Recommendation. Audit and remediation procedures with full details will be found in the section dedicated to each specific service where this recommendation applies:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Queue Storage
- Storage Accounts > Secrets and Keys
- Storage Explorer

## Expected Result

SAS tokens should have an expiration time of no more than 1 hour from creation.

## Remediation

This is a Common Reference Recommendation. Audit and remediation procedures with full details will be found in the section dedicated to each specific service where this recommendation applies:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Queue Storage
- Storage Accounts > Secrets and Keys
- Storage Explorer

## Default Value

By default, expiration for shared access signature is set to 8 hours.
