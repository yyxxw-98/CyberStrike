# 2.2 Ensure that 'Allow access only via SSL' is set to 'Yes' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Setting 'Allow access only via SSL' to 'Yes' ensures that data in transit to and from Azure Cache for Redis is encrypted using TLS.

## Rationale

Data in transit which is not encrypted is vulnerable to attacks including adversary-in-the-middle (AITM or MITM), eavesdropping, or session hijack. These attacks can result in the compromise and exfiltration of data.

## Impact

No additional cost is required to implement this recommendation. Aside from expected network changes (no unencrypted communications), performance should not be impacted.

## Audit Procedure

### Audit From Azure Portal

1. Search for and open the `Azure Cache for Redis` service
2. For each instance, repeat the remaining steps
3. Click on the name of the instance
4. In the blade menu on the left, under Settings, click on **Advanced Settings**
5. Review the setting under `Allow access only via SSL`

If **Yes** is selected, the configuration for that instance is compliant.

### Audit From Azure Policy

- **Policy ID:** `22bee202-a82f-4305-9a2a-6d7f44d4dedb` - **Name:** 'Only secure connections to your Azure Cache for Redis should be enabled'
- **Policy ID:** `766f5de3-c6c0-4327-9f4d-042ab8ae846c` - **Name:** 'Configure Azure Cache for Redis to disable non SSL ports'

## Expected Result

The `Allow access only via SSL` setting should be set to **Yes** for each Azure Cache for Redis instance.

## Remediation

### Remediate From Azure Portal

1. Search for and open the `Azure Cache for Redis` service
2. For each instance, repeat the remaining steps
3. Click on the name of the instance
4. In the blade menu on the left, under Settings, click on **Advanced Settings**
5. Select **Yes** under `Allow access only via SSL` heading

## Default Value

By default, 'Allow access only via SSL' is set to 'Yes'.
