# Ensure automatic forwarding options are disabled (Manual)

## Description

You should disable automatic forwarding to prevent users from auto-forwarding mail.

## Rationale

In the event that an attacker gains control of an end-user account they could create rules to ex-filtrate data from your environment.

## Impact

Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case auto-forwarding. Disabling auto-forwarding to remote domains will affect all users and in an organization.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Google Workspace Admin Console

1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Gmail`
5. Under `End User Access` - `Automatic forwarding`, ensure `Allow users to automatically forward incoming email to another address` is **unchecked**

### Expected Result

`Allow users to automatically forward incoming email to another address` should be unchecked.
