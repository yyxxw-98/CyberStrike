# 6.6 Ensure Suspicious login is configured

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 1

## Description

Configuring and enabling the setting that an alert will be generated when Google detects a sign-in attempt that doesn't match a user's normal behavior, such as a sign-in from an unusual location.

## Rationale

Ensuring that administrators are alerted when suspicious login attempts occur. This could be an indication of an active attack on the company by an adversary using previously obtained credentials.

## Impact

This setting should have no impact on the end user but will send emails to super administrators when triggered.

## Audit

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select **Rules**.
3. Under **Google protects you by default** select **View list**.
4. Scroll to **Suspicious login** and select it.
5. Ensure that **Alerts** is set to **On**.
6. Ensure the **Severity** is set to **Low**.
7. Ensure that **Email Notifications** is set to **On**.
8. Ensure that **Email notification recipients** is set to **All super administrators**.

## Remediation

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select **Rules**.
3. Under **Google protects you by default** select **View list**.
4. Scroll to **Suspicious login** and select it.
5. Within the **Actions** pane, click the edit pencil on the right side of the pane.
6. Select **Send to alert center** (This will result in the alert being set to On).
7. Set the alert severity to **Low**.
8. To enable emails when this alert condition is met, select **Send email notifications**. Once enabled, the **All super administrators** option is selected by default.
9. Click **Review** to confirm the values.
10. Click **Update Rule**.
11. Confirm that the **Suspicious login** shows an Alert status of **On** in the list.

## Default Value

Suspicious login is **ON**.
