# Ensure enhanced pre-delivery message scanning is enabled (Manual)

## Description

Enables improved detection of suspicious content prior to delivery.

## Rationale

As an administrator, you can increase Gmail's ability to identify suspicious content with enhanced pre-delivery message scanning. Typically, when Gmail identifies a possible phishing message, a warning is displayed and the message might be moved to spam.

## Impact

With the Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning option, when Gmail detects suspicious content, message delivery is slightly delayed so that Gmail can do additional security checks on the message.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Google Workspace Admin Console

1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Gmail`
5. Select `Spam, phishing, and malware`
6. Ensure `Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning.` is **ON**

### Expected Result

`Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning.` should be ON.

## Remediation

### Using Google Workspace Admin Console

1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Gmail`
5. Select `Spam, phishing, and malware`
6. Select `Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning.`
7. Set `Enables improved detection of suspicious content prior to delivery` to **checked**
8. Select `Save`

## Default Value

`Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning.` is **ON**
