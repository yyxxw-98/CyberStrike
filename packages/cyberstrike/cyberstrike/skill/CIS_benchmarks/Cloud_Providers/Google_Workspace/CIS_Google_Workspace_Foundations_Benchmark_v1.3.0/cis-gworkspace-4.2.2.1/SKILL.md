# 4.2.2.1 Ensure blocking access from unapproved geographic locations

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 1

## Description

Restrict access to selected Google applications by geographic location.

## Rationale

Restricting access to known/approved geographic locations is a simple way to limit where attacks can originate from. Especially for smaller organizations that do not need global access to applications.

## Impact

Valid/approved users traveling to a geographic region outside of those defined in the Access Level will not be able to access their applications.

## Audit

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

### Verify an appropriate Access Level has been defined

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Access and Data Control`
4. Select `Context-Aware Access`
5. Select `Access levels`
6. Review the list of Access Levels displayed and determine if there is an appropriate restriction on geographic access

### Verify the appropriate Access Level has been assigned to the application(s) that need the restriction

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Access and Data Control`
4. Select `Context-Aware Access`
5. Select `Assign access levels`
6. Review the list of Google Applications displayed and make sure the appropriate access level for geographic access is assigned to each

**NOTE:** CIS recommends geographically restricting access to the following Google applications at minimum:

1. Admin Console
2. Drives and Docs
3. Gmail
4. Google Vault

4. Select `Context-Aware Access`
5. Select `Assign access levels`
6. For each application listed that needs this restriction, select `Assign`
7. Under, `Access is granted when a user meets conditions in at least one of the selected access levels`, ensure the previously named Access Level (ex. "Restrict to USA") is `checked`
8. Also, ensure `Apply to Google desktop and mobile apps` is `checked`
