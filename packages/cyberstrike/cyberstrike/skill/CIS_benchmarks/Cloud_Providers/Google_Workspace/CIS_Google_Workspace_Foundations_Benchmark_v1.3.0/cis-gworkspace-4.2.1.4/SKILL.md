# 4.2.1.4 Review domain-wide delegation for applications periodically

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 2

## Description

Weekly review domain-wide delegations for applications for potentially malicious or unintended access or connections.

## Rationale

Domain-wide delegation is a powerful feature that allows apps to access users' data across your organization's entire Workspace account. Performing a periodic review of domain-wide delegations for applications and their permission scopes ensures only permitted and required applications can access organizational data or resources.

## Audit

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Access and Data Control`
4. Select `API Controls`
5. Under `Domain wide delegation`, select `MANAGE DOMAIN WIDE DELEGATION`
6. Ensure all listed applications have been properly vetted and authorized by the appropriate personnel

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Access and Data Control`
4. Select `API Controls`
5. Under `Domain wide delegation`, select `MANAGE DOMAIN WIDE DELEGATION`
6. Select `Change Access` for the application you wish to remove
7. Now `Delete` the desired application

## Default Value

None
