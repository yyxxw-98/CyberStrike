# 3.1.2.1.2.2 Ensure manager access members cannot modify shared drive settings

## Level

L1

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 1

## Type

Manual

## Description

Only administrators should be able to modify shared drive settings.

## Rationale

Allowing manager access members to override or modify shared drive settings can allow intentional and unintentional data access by unauthorized users.

## Impact

Disabling this feature will prevent manager access members from modifying shared drive settings, requiring administrators to perform settings modifications as required.

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Drive and Docs`
5. Select `Sharing settings`
6. Under `Shared drive creation`, ensure `Allow members with manager access to override the settings below` is `unchecked`

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Drive and Docs`
5. Select `Sharing settings`
6. Under `Shared drive creation`, set `Allow members with manager access to override the settings below` to `unchecked`
7. Select `Save`

## Default Value

`Allow members with manager access to override the settings below` is `checked`
