# 3.1.2.1.1.1 Ensure users are warned when they share a file outside their domain

## Level

L1

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 1

## Type

Manual

## Description

Warn the user when they try and share a file and/or shared drive externally.

## Rationale

The user may not realize the potential account is external to the organization. Providing a warning allows the user an opportunity to know this and possibly reassess this sharing.

## Impact

None, except an additional warning. Sharing can still occur.

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`

5. Select `Sharing Options`
6. Under `Sharing outside of <Company>`
7. Ensure `ON - Files owned by users in <Company> can be shared outside of <Company>. This applies to files in all shared drives as well.` is `checked`. Also, ensure the sub-setting `For files owned by users in <Company> warn when sharing outside of <Company>` is `checked`.
