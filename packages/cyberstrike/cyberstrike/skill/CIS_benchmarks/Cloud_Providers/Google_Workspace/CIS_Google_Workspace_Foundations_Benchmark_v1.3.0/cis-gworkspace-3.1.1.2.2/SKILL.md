# 3.1.1.2.2 Ensure internal sharing options for secondary calendars are configured (Manual)

## Description

Control how much calendar information users in your organization can share internally.

## Rationale

In general, not everyone in the organization needs to know the schedule details of everyone else (operational security). Free/busy indication is enough for most people.

## Impact

This will be the default for the user's secondary calendars. The user can override this setting to allow other specific users greater visibility of their calendars.

## Audit Procedure

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Calendar`
5. Under `General settings`, select `Internal sharing options for secondary calendars`
6. Ensure `Only free/busy information (hide event details)` is selected

## Expected Result

`Only free/busy information (hide event details)` should be selected for internal sharing options for secondary calendars.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator
2. Select `Apps`
3. Select `Google Workspace`
4. Select `Calendar`
5. Under `General settings`, select `Internal sharing options for secondary calendars`
6. Select `Only free/busy information (hide event details)`
7. Select `Save`

## Default Value

`Internal sharing options for secondary calendars` is `Share all information`
