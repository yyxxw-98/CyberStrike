This report should be reviewed weekly.

**NOTE:** In larger organizations reviewing this entire report weekly may not be possible. At a minimum, all Administrator and Super Administrator users should be reviewed, since they are a higher risk. These can be filtered from the overall user list.

## Rationale

The App usage report can allow administrator to discover user that are potentially using application that they do not have access to and/or using in atypical ways.

## Impact

No user impact.

## Audit

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select **Reporting**.
3. Select **Reports**.
4. Select **User Reports**.
5. Select **App usage**, and a table of results will be displayed with the fields listed in the Recommendation description above.
6. Review the displayed users and values for anomalies.

## Remediation

The remediation for any anomalies in the various fields varies widely (different sections of the Google Workspace Admin UI). Please refer to Google's documentation for specifics.

**NOTE:** Many of these settings will be remedied by implementing other sections of this Benchmark. For example, an Admin showing recent Gmail (IMAP) - last used time and/or Gmail (POP) - last used time can be remedied by implementing the Remediation procedure for the recommendation _Ensure POP and IMAP access is disabled for all users_.

## Default Value

The report will display all users and fields.
