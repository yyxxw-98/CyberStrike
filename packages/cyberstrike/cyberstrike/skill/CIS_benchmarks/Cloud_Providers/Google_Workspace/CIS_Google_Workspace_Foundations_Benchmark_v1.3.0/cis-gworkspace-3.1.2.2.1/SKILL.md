# 3.1.2.2.1 Ensure offline access to documents is disabled

## Level

L1

## Profile Applicability

- Enterprise Level 1

## Type

Manual

## Description

Prevent documents from being locally accessible on an unconnected device.

## Rationale

This setting prevents an organization's files from being stored locally, thus limiting data loss issues if the device is lost or stolen.

## Impact

Copies of recent files are only synced and saved on devices if you've defined a managed policy to do so.

**NOTE:** All users will lose access to offline documents on all devices if managed devices policies are not set.

**NOTE:** Setting up policies to control offline access on individual devices is outside the scope of this Benchmark. Additional information on doing this for various device types can be found in Google documentation.

7. Ensure `Control offline access using device policies` is `checked`
