# Ensure session disconnect timeout is set to 5 minutes or less (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Disconnect timeout in minutes, is the amount of of time that a streaming session remains active after users disconnect.

## Rationale

If users try to reconnect to the streaming session after a disconnection or network interruption within the 5 minutes, they are connected to their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance and that instance isn't sitting out there not being used.

## Impact

None - this is a security best practice.

## Audit Procedure
