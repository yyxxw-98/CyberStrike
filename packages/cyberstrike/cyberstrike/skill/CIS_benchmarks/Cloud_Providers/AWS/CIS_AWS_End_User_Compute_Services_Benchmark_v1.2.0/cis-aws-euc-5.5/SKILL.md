# Ensure session Idle disconnect timeout is set to 10 minutes or less (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Idle disconnect timeout in minutes is the amount of time that users can be inactive before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the Disconnect timeout in minutes time begins.

## Rationale

Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. Once disconnected from their streaming session the Disconnect timeout begins.

## Impact

None - this is a security best practice.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following steps to view the Fleet settings in AppStream.

### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AppStream 2.0 console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2`
2. In the left pane click on **Fleets**
3. Select the link for the fleet name you wish to view
4. Scroll to the **Fleet configuration** section and confirm that Idle disconnect timeout is set to **10** minutes or less

If Idle disconnect timeout is set to anything greater than 10 minutes refer to the remediation below.
