# Ensure maximum session duration is no longer than 10 hours (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

When creating a fleet for AppStream 2.0 configure the Maximum session duration in minutes to be no greater than 600.

## Rationale

Having a session duration lasting longer than 10 hours should not be necessary and if running for any malicious reasons provides a greater time for usage than should be allowed.
