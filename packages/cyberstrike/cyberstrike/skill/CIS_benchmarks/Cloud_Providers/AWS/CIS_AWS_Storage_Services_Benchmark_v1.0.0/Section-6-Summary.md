### Key Themes

1. **EDR Configuration** (6.1, 6.2, 6.13)
   - Initial setup and network architecture
   - Complete EDR functionality verification

2. **IAM & Security** (6.5)
   - Least-privilege access
   - MFA enforcement
   - Role-based access control

3. **Agent & Replication** (6.3, 6.4, 6.6)
   - Replication agent installation
   - Replication settings configuration
   - Network connectivity

4. **Launch & Recovery** (6.7, 6.8, 6.10, 6.11)
   - Launch settings configuration
   - Recovery drill execution
   - Failover procedures
   - Failback processes

5. **Continuous Operations** (6.9, 6.12)
   - Ongoing DR operations
   - CloudWatch monitoring
   - Metrics and alerting

### Common CIS Controls Mappings

- **v8 11.2** - Perform Automated Backups
- **v8 11.4** - Establish and Maintain an Isolated Instance of Recovery Data
- **v8 11.5** - Test Data Recovery
- **v7 10.2** - Perform Complete System Backups
- **v7 10.4** - Ensure Protection of Backups

### Network Requirements

All EDR controls require proper network configuration:

- **TCP 443** - HTTPS access to EDR, S3, EC2 endpoints
- **TCP 1500** - Replication traffic between source and staging area

### Usage in CyberStrike

These skills can be invoked in CyberStrike to audit AWS EDR configurations:

```bash
# Audit all Section 6 controls
cyberstrike run "Audit CIS AWS Storage Section 6 controls"

# Audit specific control
cyberstrike run "Check CIS 6.1 - EDR Configuration"

# Remediate specific control
cyberstrike run "Remediate CIS 6.5 - IAM for EDR"
```
