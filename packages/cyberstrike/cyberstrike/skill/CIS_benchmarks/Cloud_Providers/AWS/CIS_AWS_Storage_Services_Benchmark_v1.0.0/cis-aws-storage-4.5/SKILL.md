# 4.5 Ensure installation and configuration of Lustre Client (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

To utilize the newly created File Cache, you must install the Lustre Client on your EC2 instance.

## Rationale

The Lustre Client facilitates efficient communication between the EC2 instance and the File Cache, ensuring high-performance data access and improved overall system efficiency. This setup is crucial for optimizing data processing and leveraging the benefits of the File Cache.

## Impact

Without the Lustre Client installed, EC2 instances cannot mount or access the FSx File Cache, resulting in inability to leverage the high-performance caching capabilities and potential performance degradation for data-intensive workloads.

## Audit Procedure

### AWS Console

This is a client-side configuration that cannot be audited through the AWS Console. Use SSH to connect to EC2 instances and verify Lustre client installation.

### AWS CLI & SSH

1. Connect to your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i "{KEY.pem}" ubuntu@{your-ec2-instance}
```

2. Verify Lustre client installation:

```bash
# Check if Lustre client is installed
dpkg -l | grep lustre

# Check Lustre client version
modinfo lustre

# Verify kernel compatibility
uname -r
```

## Expected Result

The Lustre client should be properly installed with:

- Lustre client modules present in the system
- Compatible kernel version (5.15.0.1020-aws or later for Ubuntu 22.02)
- Lustre repository configured
- Client modules loaded and available

## Remediation

### SSH to EC2 Instance

Follow these steps to install the Lustre Client on Ubuntu 22.04:

1. **Launch your EC2 instance.** Navigate to the folder of your secure key and ssh into the instance using this command:

```bash
ssh -i "{KEY.pem}" ubuntu@{your-ec2-instance}
```

2. When prompted to log in with the SSH key, enter "yes"

3. You should now be connected to your EC2 instance

4. **Run the following command to download and install the public Lustre key:**

```bash
wget -O - https://fsx-lustre-client-repo-public-keys.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx-ubuntu-public-key.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/fsx-ubuntu-public-key.gpg >/dev/null
```

5. **Add the AWS Lustre package repository to your local package manager using the following command:**

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/fsx-ubuntu-public-key.gpg] https://fsx-lustre-client-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu jammy main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fsxlustreclientrepo.list && apt-get update'
```

6. **Determine which kernel is currently running on your client instance and update as needed.** The AWS Lustre client on Ubuntu 22.02 requires kernel 5.15.0.1020-aws or later for both x86 based EC2 instances and Arm-based EC2 instanced powered by AWS Graviton processors:

   a. Run the following command to find out which kernel your machine is running:

   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

   b. If your kernel is not up to date, run the following command to install the kernel update, Lustre client update, and reboot your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y linux-aws lustre-client-modules-aws && sudo reboot
   ```

   c. If your kernel is up to date and you just want to install the latest Lustre version, run this command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y lustre-client-modules-$(uname -r)
   ```

7. **Verify installation:**

```bash
# Check installed packages
dpkg -l | grep lustre

# Verify Lustre module
modinfo lustre

# Check if module can be loaded
sudo modprobe lustre
```

## Default Value

By default, the Lustre client is not installed on EC2 instances. It must be explicitly installed on compatible operating systems.
