# Ensure EBS volume encryption is enabled in all regions

## Description

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service. While disabled by default, forcing encryption at EBS volume creation is supported.

## Rationale

Encrypting data at rest reduces the likelihood of unintentional exposure and can nullify the impact of disclosure if the encryption remains unbroken.

## Impact

Losing access to or removing the KMS key used by the EBS volumes will result in the inability to access the volumes.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. Under `Account attributes`, click `Data Protection and Security`.
3. Under `EBS encryption`, verify that `Always encrypt new EBS volumes` displays `Enabled`.
4. Repeat for each region in use.

**Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws --region <region> ec2 get-ebs-encryption-by-default
```

2. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` is displayed.
3. Repeat for each region in use.

## Expected Result

`"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` should be displayed for every region in use.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. Under `Account attributes`, click `Data protection and security`.
3. Under `EBS encryption`, Click `Manage`.
4. Check the `Enable` box to default encryption.
5. Click `Update EBS encryption`.
6. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws --region <region> ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
```

2. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` is displayed.
3. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

**Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

## Default Value

By default, EBS volume encryption is disabled. It must be manually enabled per region; otherwise, new EBS volumes are created unencrypted.

## Additional Information

Default EBS volume encryption only applies to newly created EBS volumes; existing EBS volumes are **not** converted automatically.
