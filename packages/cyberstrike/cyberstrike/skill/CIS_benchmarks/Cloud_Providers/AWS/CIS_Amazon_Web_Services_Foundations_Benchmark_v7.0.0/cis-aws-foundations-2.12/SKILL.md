# Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less

## Description

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests to AWS. IAM users require access keys to make programmatic calls via the AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs. It is recommended that all access keys be rotated regularly and at least every 90 days.

## Rationale

Rotating access keys reduces the window of opportunity for a compromised or exposed key to be used. Regular rotation also limits the risk associated with lost, stolen, or improperly stored credentials.

## Impact

Long-lived access keys increase the risk of unauthorized access if compromised, as they may remain valid indefinitely without detection.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam
2. Click on `Users`
3. For each user, go to `Security Credentials`
4. Review each key under `Access Keys`
5. For each key with `Status = Active`, ensure the `Created` date is within `90 days`

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run the following commands:

```bash
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d
```

2. Review the following fields:

- `access_key_1_last_rotated`
- `access_key_2_last_rotated`

3. Ensure all active keys have been rotated within `90 days`

## Expected Result

All active access keys should have a `last_rotated` date within the last 90 days. No access key should be older than 90 days.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

Perform the following to rotate access keys:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)
2. Click on `Users`
3. Select the user
4. Navigate to `Security credentials`

Rotate Access Keys:

5. Click `Create access` key
6. Update all applications and tools to use the new access key
7. After confirming successful use of the new key:

- Deactivate the old key
- Delete the old key when no longer needed

### Using AWS CLI

1. Create a new access key:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <user-name>
```

2. Update all applications and tools to use the new access key

3. Check usage of the old key:

```bash
aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id <access-key-id>
```

4. Deactivate the old key:

```bash
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --status Inactive --user-name <user-name>
```

5. After confirming no usage, delete the old key:

```bash
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
```

## Default Value

By default, AWS does not enforce access key rotation. Access keys remain valid until manually deactivated or deleted.
