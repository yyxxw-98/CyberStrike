# Ensure Images are not Publicly Available

## Description

EC2 allows you to make an AMI public, sharing it with all AWS accounts.

## Rationale

Publicly sharing an AMI with all AWS accounts could expose organizational data and configuration information.

## Impact

Making an AMI private may affect other AWS accounts that depend on it. Ensure shared accounts are explicitly added if needed.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS CLI

No specific CLI audit command is provided for this control. Use the console method below.

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. In the left pane, under `Images`, click `AMIs`.
3. Confirm the `Owned by me` is set.
4. Select the AMI from the list.
5. Click on the `Permissions` Tab.
6. If this reads `This image is currently Public`, please refer to the remediation below.

## Expected Result

All AMIs should have their permissions set to Private. No AMI should display "This image is currently Public" in the Permissions tab.

## Remediation
