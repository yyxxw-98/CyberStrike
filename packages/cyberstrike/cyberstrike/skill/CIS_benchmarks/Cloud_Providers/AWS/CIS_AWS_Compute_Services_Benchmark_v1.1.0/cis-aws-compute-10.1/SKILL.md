# 10.1 Ensure Managed Platform updates is configured (Manual)

## Description

AWS Elastic Beanstalk regularly releases platform updates to provide fixes, software updates, and new features. With managed platform updates, you can configure your environment to automatically upgrade to the latest version of a platform during a scheduled maintenance window.

## Rationale

Your application remains in service during the update process with no reduction in capacity. Managed updates are available on both single-instance and load-balanced environments. They also ensure you aren't introducing any vulnerabilities by running legacy systems that require updates and patches.
