# Ensure encryption in transit is enabled for Lambda environment variables

## Description

As you can set your own environmental variables for Lambda it is important to also encrypt them for in transit protection.

## Rationale

Lambda environment variables should be encrypted in transit for client-side protection as they can store sensitive information.

## Impact

Enabling encryption in transit adds encryption overhead and may require updates to Lambda function code to decrypt environment variables at runtime.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.
2. In the left column, under `AWS Lambda`, click `Functions`.
3. Under `Function name` click on the name of the function that you want to review
4. Click the Configuration tab
5. In the left column, click `Environment variables`.
6. In the `Environment variables` section, click `Edit`
7. On the Edit environment variables page, review the Values. If they are a long value that resembles this:
   AQICAHhxbKJYcFAU16CbU4IVpzi5CwK
   Encryption is in place for that Key. If the value is in plain text refer to the remediation below.
8. Repeat steps 2 - 7 for each Lambda function available in the current AWS region.
9. Repeat this Audit for all the other AWS regions.

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run `aws lambda list-functions`

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --output table --query "Functions[*].FunctionName"
```

This command will provide a table titled ListFunctions

2. Run `aws lambda get-function`

```bash
aws lambda get-function --function-name "name_of_function" --query "Configuration.Environment"
```

This will provide an output of the environment variables created for that function.

3. Review the Values in the table. If they contain a long value that resembles this:
   AQICAHhxbKJYcFAU16CbU4IVpzi5CwK. Encryption is in place for that Key. If the value is in plain text refer to the remediation below.
4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each Lambda function listed in the current region.
5. Repeat this Audit for all the other AWS regions.

## Expected Result

All Lambda function environment variable values are encrypted in transit (values appear as encrypted ciphertext rather than plain text).

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.
2. In the left column, under `AWS Lambda`, click `Functions`.
3. Under `Function name` click on the name of the function that you want to review
4. Click the Configuration tab
5. In the left column, click `Environment variables`.
6. In the `Environment variables` section, click `Edit`
7. Click the check box for `Enable helpers for encryption in transit`
8. Click the `Encrypt` option for all the variable that need to be encrypted.
9. Repeat steps 2 - 8 for each Lambda function identified in the Audit within the current AWS region.
10. Repeat this remediation for all the other AWS regions.

### Using AWS CLI

N/A - This control is Console-based remediation only.

## Default Value

Lambda environment variables are encrypted at rest by default using AWS managed keys, but encryption in transit (client-side encryption) is not enabled by default.
