# Ensure Amazon ECS services are tagged

## Description

Ensure all Amazon ECS services have resource tags to facilitate asset management, tracking, and compliance.

## Rationale

Consistent tagging supports compliance and helps identify unauthorized or misconfigured resources.

## Impact

There is minimal administrative overhead associated with implementing and maintaining resource tags.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Clusters`.
3. Click the name of a cluster.
4. Under `Services`, click the name of a service.
5. Click `Tags`.
6. Ensure at least one tag is listed that does not begin with `aws:`. Tags prefixed with `aws:` are AWS-managed.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each ECS cluster and service.

### Using AWS CLI

Run the following command to list clusters:

```
aws ecs list-clusters
```

Run the following command to list services in a cluster:

```
aws ecs list-services --cluster <cluster-arn>
```

Run the following command to view the tags for a service:

```
aws ecs list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn <service-arn>
```

Ensure that tags are returned that do not begin with `aws:`. Tags prefixed with `aws:` are AWS-managed.
Repeat for each cluster and service.

## Expected Result

All ECS services should have at least one user-defined tag (not prefixed with `aws:`).

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Clusters`.
3. Click the name of a cluster.
4. Under `Services`, click the name of a service.
5. Click `Tags`.
6. Click `Manage tags`.
7. Click `Add tag`.
8. Provide a `Key` and optional `Value` for the tag.
9. Click `Save`.
10. Repeat steps 1-9 for each ECS cluster and service requiring remediation.

### Using AWS CLI

Use the `aws ecs tag-resource` command to add tags to a service:

```
aws ecs tag-resource --resource-arn <service-arn> --tags key=<TagKey>,value=<TagValue>
```

## Default Value

By default, Amazon ECS services are not tagged.
