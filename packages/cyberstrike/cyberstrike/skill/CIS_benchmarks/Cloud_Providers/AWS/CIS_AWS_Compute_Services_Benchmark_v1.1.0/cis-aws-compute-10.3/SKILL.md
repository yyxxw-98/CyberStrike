# 10.3 Ensure access logs are enabled (Manual)

## Description

When you enable load balancing, your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment is equipped with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to distribute traffic among the instances in your environment.

## Rationale

For security reasons it is important to have a record of all the access logs and this is enabled within the Load Balancer assigned to the Elastic Beanstalk environments.

## Impact

N/A

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2
2. On the left hand scroll down to Load Balancing and click on `Load Balancers`
3. Click on the Load balancer associated with the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

```
Typically they have AWSEB in the name.
If you utilized Elastic Beanstalk to create the Load balancer the Source
Security Group listed in the Description will reference `Elastic Beanstalk`
```

4. Under the `Description` tab scroll down to the `Attributes` section
5. Confirm `Access logs` is set to Enabled.
6. If status options reads `Disabled` refer to the remediation below.
7. Repeat steps 3-8 for each environment within the current region.
8. Then repeat the Audit process for all other regions.

### Using AWS CLI

## Expected Result

`Access logs` is set to Enabled under the Attributes section on the Load Balancer Description tab.

8. Click `Save`
9. Scroll down under the description tab and confirm that the Access logs are set as described above.
10. Repeat steps 3-11 for each Load balancer created and used with Elastic Beanstalk environment within the current region.
