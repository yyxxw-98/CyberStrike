# 5.9 Ensure that your Lightsail buckets are not publicly accessible (Manual)

## Description

You can make all objects private, public (read-only) or private while making individual objects public (read-only). By default when creating a bucket the permissions are set to "All objects are private".

## Rationale

When the Bucket access permissions are set to All objects are public (read-only) - All objects in the bucket are readable by anyone on the internet through the URL of the bucket.

## Impact

N/A

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Click `All services`, click `Lightsail` under Compute.
3. This will open up the Lightsail console.
4. Select `Storage`.
5. All Lightsail buckets are listed here.
6. Underneath the bucket name and size there are 3 possible statements:

```
All objects are private
All objects are public (read-Only)
Individual objects can be public
```

7. If any buckets are set to `All objects are public (read-Only)` and or 'Individual objects can be public' refer to the remediation below.

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run `aws lightsail get-buckets`

```bash
aws lightsail get-buckets
```

This command will provide a list of Buckets tied to Lightsail.

2. Review the accessRules, getobject and allowPublicOverrides.

```json
"accessRules": {
    "getObject": "private",
    "allowPublicOverrides": false
}
```

4. If it reads "getObject": "public" or "allowPublicOverrides": true please make note "name" of the bucket also listed in the output.
5. Then refer to the remediation below.

## Expected Result

All Lightsail buckets should have access rules set to `"getObject": "private"` and `"allowPublicOverrides": false`, meaning all objects are private.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Click `All services`, click `Lightsail` under Compute.
3. This will open up the Lightsail console.
4. Select `Storage`.
5. All Lightsail buckets are listed here.
6. Click on the bucket name that has `All objects are public (read-Only)` listed.
7. Click on `Permissions`
8. Click on `Change permissions`
9. Select `All objects are private`
10. Click `Save`
11. Repeat for any other Buckets within Lightsail that are set with `All objects are public (read-Only)` and/or `Individual objects can be made public and read only`

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run `aws lightsail update-bucket`

```bash
aws lightsail update-bucket --bucket-name <name from list in audit> --access-rules getObject="private",allowPublicOverrides=false
```

2. The confirmation that the change was made will print out after running that command.
3. Repeat for any other buckets listed in the audit.

## Default Value

By default when creating a bucket the permissions are set to "All objects are private".
