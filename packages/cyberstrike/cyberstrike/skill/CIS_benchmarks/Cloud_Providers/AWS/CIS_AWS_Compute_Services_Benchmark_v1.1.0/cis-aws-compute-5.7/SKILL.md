# 5.7 Ensure you are using an IAM policy to manage access to buckets in Lightsail (Manual)

## Description

The following policy grants a user access to manage a specific bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service.

## Rationale

This policy grants access to buckets through the Lightsail console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS API, and AWS SDKs.

## Impact

Users who don't have this policy will experience errors when viewing the Objects tab of the bucket management page in the Lightsail console.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to AWS Console using https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Click `All services`, click `IAM` under Security, Identity, & Compliance.
3. Click `Policies`
4. Click in the `Filter policies by property or policy name and press enter`
5. Type `Lightsail` and press enter
6. Click on the policy that contains lightsail in the name
7. Make sure the `Permissions` tab is selected.
8. Confirm the policy looks like this

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "LightsailAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "lightsail:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "S3BucketAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BucketName>/*", "arn:aws:s3:::<BucketName>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

9. If this policy is in place move to the next step. If it is not in any of the policies listed for `lightsail` refer to the remediation below.
10. Click on the `Policy usage` tab
11. Confirm that the correct Group and/or User is listed under Permissions. If there is no one listed here refer to the remediation below.

### Using AWS CLI
