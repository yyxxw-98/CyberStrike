# Ensure logging is configured for Amazon ECS task definitions

## Description

Configure logging for Amazon ECS task definitions to capture detailed application and container activity.

Note: This recommendation assumes that only the latest active revision of a task definition is in use. If older revisions are in use, apply the audit and remediation procedures to those revisions as needed.

## Rationale

Logging facilitates effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and incident response, improving security and enabling rapid threat detection.

## Impact

Logging can incur costs for storage and processing, along with initial configuration and ongoing management.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Task definitions`.
3. Click the name of a task definition.
4. Click on the latest active revision of the task definition.
5. Click `JSON`.
6. Ensure that at least one element under `containerDefinitions` has a `logConfiguration` property defined, and that the value for `logDriver` is not `null`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each task definition.

### Using AWS CLI

Run the following command to list task definitions:

```
aws ecs list-task-definitions
```

For the latest revision of a task definition, run the following command:

```
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-arn> --query 'taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[*].logConfiguration'
```

Ensure that the command returns at least one `logConfiguration` object, and that the value for `logDriver` is not `null`.
Repeat for each task definition.

## Expected Result

At least one container in each task definition should have a `logConfiguration` with a valid `logDriver` configured.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Task definitions`.
3. Click the name of a task definition.
4. Click on the latest active revision of the task definition.
5. Click `Create new revision`.
6. Click `Create new revision` again.
7. For at least one container, under `Logging` > `Log collection`, check the box next to `Use log collection` and further configure the log collection options as needed.
8. Click Create.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each task definition requiring remediation.

Note: When a task definition is updated, running tasks launched from the previous task definition remain unchanged. Updating a running task requires redeploying it with the new task definition.

### Using AWS CLI

No specific CLI remediation provided. Register a new task definition revision with `logConfiguration` configured using `aws ecs register-task-definition`.

## Default Value

Logging is enabled by default when a task definition is created via the console.
