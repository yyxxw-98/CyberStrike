# Ensure monitoring is enabled for Amazon ECS clusters

## Description

Enable AWS CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon ECS clusters to monitor resource usage, performance, and application health through metrics and logs.

## Rationale

Monitoring ECS clusters with Container Insights improves visibility, supports faster issue detection, and enhances security by identifying anomalies and resource bottlenecks.

## Impact

Enabling AWS CloudWatch Container Insights for ECS clusters incurs costs for metrics, log ingestion, storage, and alarms.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Clusters`.
3. For each cluster listed in the `CloudWatch monitoring` column, ensure that `Container Insights` is displayed.

### Using AWS CLI

Run the following command to list clusters:

```
aws ecs list-clusters
```

Run the following command to view the settings for a cluster:

```
aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters <cluster-arn> --include SETTINGS --query 'clusters[*].settings'
```

Ensure `containerInsights` is set to `enabled` or `enhanced`.

## Expected Result

`containerInsights` should be set to `enabled` or `enhanced` for all ECS clusters.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the ECS console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. In the left panel, click `Clusters`.
3. Click the name of a cluster.
4. Click `Update cluster`.
5. Under `Monitoring`, select the radio button next to `Container Insights` or `Container Insights with enhanced observability`.
6. Click `Update`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each ECS cluster requiring remediation.

### Using AWS CLI

For each cluster requiring remediation, run the following command to enable `containerInsights`:

```
aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster <cluster-arn> --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled
```

## Default Value

Monitoring is disabled by default for Amazon ECS clusters.
