# 6.2.20 Ensure shadow group is empty (Automated)

## Description

The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

## Rationale

Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/shadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:

```bash
# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd
```

## Expected Result

No results should be returned.

## Remediation

Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group.
