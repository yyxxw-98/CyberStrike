# 4.1.3 Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured (Automated)

## Description

Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system, or on log hosts others as well.

## Rationale

It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify that other has no permissions on any files and group does not have write or execute permissions on any files:

```bash
# find /var/log -type f -ls
```

## Expected Result

The output should show that no files have permissions allowing other users to read, write, or execute, and group does not have write or execute permissions.

## Remediation

Run the following commands to set permissions on all existing log files:

```bash
find /var/log -type f -exec chmod g-wx,o-rwx "{}" + -o -type d -exec chmod g-w,o-rwx "{}" +
```

## Default Value

You may also need to change the configuration for your logging software or services for any logs that had incorrect permissions.
