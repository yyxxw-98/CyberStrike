# 4.1.2.2 Ensure journald is configured to write logfiles to persistent disk (Automated)

## Description

Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Logs in memory will be lost upon a system reboot. By persisting logs to local disk on the server they are protected from loss.

## Rationale

Writing log data to disk will provide the ability to forensically reconstruct events which may have impacted the operations or security of a system even after a system crash or reboot.

## Audit Procedure

Review `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` and verify that logs are persisted to disk:

```bash
# grep -e Storage /etc/systemd/journald.conf
# Storage=persistent
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `Storage=persistent`.

## Remediation

Edit the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and add the following line:

```
Storage=persistent
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.

## Default Value

The main configuration file `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` is read before any of the custom \*.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters.
