# 6.2.4 Ensure no legacy "+" entries exist in /etc/group (Automated)

## Description

The character + in various files used to be markers for systems to insert data from NIS maps at a certain point in a system configuration file. These entries are no longer required on most systems, but may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms.

## Rationale

These entries may provide an avenue for attackers to gain privileged access on the system.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:

```bash
# grep '^\+:' /etc/group
```

## Expected Result

No output should be returned.

## Remediation

Remove any legacy '+' entries from `/etc/group` if they exist.
