# 5.4 Ensure root login is restricted to system console (Manual)

## Description

The file `/etc/securetty` contains a list of valid terminals that may be logged in directly as root.

## Rationale

Since the system console has special properties to handle emergency situations, it is important to ensure that the console is in a physically secure location and that unauthorized consoles have not been defined.

## Audit Procedure

```bash
# cat /etc/securetty
```

## Expected Result

Only consoles that are in a physically secure location should be listed in `/etc/securetty`.

## Remediation

Remove entries for any consoles that are not in a physically secure location.
