# 1.3.1 Ensure authentication required for single user mode (Automated)

## Description

Single user mode (rescue mode) is used for recovery when the system detects an issue during boot or by manual selection from the bootloader.

## Rationale

Requiring authentication in single user mode (rescue mode) prevents an unauthorized user from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify that `/sbin/sulogin` or `/usr/sbin/sulogin` is used as shown:

```bash
# grep /systemd-sulogin-shell /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service

ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

# grep /systemd-sulogin-shell /usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service

ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell emergency
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue` for rescue.service and `ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell emergency` for emergency.service.

## Remediation

Rootfs is read-only file system. Therefore, update to an OS image which requires single user mode authentication.
