# 6.1.1 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd are configured (Automated)

## Description

The `/etc/passwd` file contains user account information that is used by many system utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate.

## Rationale

It is critical to ensure that the `/etc/passwd` file is protected from unauthorized write access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644`:

```bash
# stat /etc/passwd
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Expected Result

`Uid` and `Gid` should both be `0/root` and `Access` should be `644`.

## Remediation

Run the following command to set permissions on `/etc/passwd`:

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/passwd
# chmod 644 /etc/passwd
```
