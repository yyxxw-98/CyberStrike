# 1.1.11 Ensure nosuid option set on /dev/shm partition (Automated)

## Description

The `nosuid` mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain `setuid` files.

## Rationale

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them.

## Audit Procedure

Verify that the `nosuid` option is set if a `/dev/shm` partition exists.
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

```bash
# mount | grep -E '\s/dev/shm\s' | grep -v nosuid
```

## Expected Result

The command should return no output, confirming that the `nosuid` option is set on the `/dev/shm` partition.

## Remediation

Run the following command to remount `/dev/shm`:

```bash
# mount -o remount,nosuid /dev/shm
```

**Note:** `/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
