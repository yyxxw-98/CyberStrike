# 4.1.1.3 Ensure logging is configured (Manual)

## Description

For an image using stackdriver, the `/etc/stackdriver/logging.config.d/*.conf` files specifies rules for logging and which files are to be used to log certain classes of messages. An image using fluent-bit uses `/usr/share/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf` for the same purpose.

## Rationale

A great deal of important security-related information is sent via logging (e.g., successful and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.).

## Audit Procedure

Review the contents of the `/etc/stackdriver/logging.config.d/*.conf` if using an image with stackdriver or `/usr/share/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf` if using an image with fluent-bit to ensure appropriate logging is set. In addition, run the following command and verify that the log files are logging information:

```bash
# ls -l /var/log/
```

## Expected Result

The output should show log files with recent timestamps, indicating active logging.

## Remediation

Edit the contents of `/etc/stackdriver/logging.config.d/*.conf` if using an image with stackdriver or `/usr/share/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf` if using an image with fluent-bit as appropriate for your environment.

Then run the following commands to reload the logging configuration:

For stackdriver-logging:

```bash
# systemctl restart stackdriver-logging
```

For fluent-bit:

```bash
# systemctl restart fluent-bit
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above need to be performed after every boot for images using stackdriver. This is not the case for fluent-bit as the logging agent is in `/usr/share/` which isn't stateless so changes will be persistent across reboots.
