# 1.1.6 Ensure nosuid option set on /var partition (Automated)

## Description

The `nosuid` mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain `setuid` files.

## Rationale

Since the `/var` filesystem is only intended for temporary dynamic data, set this option to ensure that users cannot create `setuid` files in `/var`.

## Audit Procedure

Verify that the `nosuid` option is set if a `/var` partition exists.
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

```bash
# mount | grep -E '\s/var\s' | grep -v nosuid
```

## Expected Result

The command should return no output, confirming that the `nosuid` option is set on the `/var` partition.

## Remediation

Run the following command to remount `/var`:

```bash
# mount -o remount,nosuid /var
```

**Note:** `/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
