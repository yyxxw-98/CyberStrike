# 3.1.1 Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Automated)

## Description

ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.

## Rationale

An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

```bash
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
# grep "net\.ipv4\.conf\.all\.send_redirects" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
# grep "net\.ipv4\.conf\.default\.send_redirects" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects= 0
```

## Expected Result

All sysctl commands should return a value of `0` and grep commands should confirm the settings are persisted in configuration files.

## Remediation

Set the following parameters in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a `/etc/sysctl.d/*` file:

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
```

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

```bash
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
