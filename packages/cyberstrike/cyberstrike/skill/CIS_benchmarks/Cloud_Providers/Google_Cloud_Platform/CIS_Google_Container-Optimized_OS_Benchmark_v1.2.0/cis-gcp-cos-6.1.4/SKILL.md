# 6.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow are configured (Automated)

## Description

The `/etc/gshadow` file is used to store the information about groups that is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information.

## Rationale

If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/gshadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/gshadow` file (such as group administrators) could also be useful to subvert the group.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify verify `Uid` is `0/root`, `Gid` is `0/root` or `<gid>/shadow`, and `Access` is `640` or more restrictive:

```bash
# stat /etc/gshadow
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Expected Result

`Uid` should be `0/root`, `Gid` should be `0/root` or `<gid>/shadow`, and `Access` should be `640` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the one of the following chown commands as appropriate and the chmod to set permissions on `/etc/gshadow`:

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/gshadow
# chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow

# chmod o-rwx,g-rw /etc/gshadow
```
