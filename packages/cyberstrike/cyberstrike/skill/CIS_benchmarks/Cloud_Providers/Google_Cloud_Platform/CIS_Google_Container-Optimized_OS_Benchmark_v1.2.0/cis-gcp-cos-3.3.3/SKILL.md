# 3.3.3 Ensure iptables is installed (Automated)

## Description

`iptables` allows configuration of the IPv4 and IPv6 tables in the linux kernel and the rules stored within them. Most firewall configuration utilities operate as a front end to `iptables`.

## Rationale

iptables is required for firewall management and configuration.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify iptables is installed:

```bash
grep '"name": "iptables"' /etc/cos-package-info.json
```

## Expected Result

```
"name": "iptables"
```

## Remediation

Update to an OS image that includes the iptables package.
