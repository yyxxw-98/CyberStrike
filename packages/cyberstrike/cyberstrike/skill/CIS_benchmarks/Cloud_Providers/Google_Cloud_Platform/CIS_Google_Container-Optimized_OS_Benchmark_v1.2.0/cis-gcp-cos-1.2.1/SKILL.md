# 1.2.1 Ensure dm-verity is enabled (Automated)

## Description

device-mapper-verity (dm-verity) kernel feature provides transparent integrity checking of block devices using a cryptographic digest provided by the kernel crypto API. When a dm-verity device is configured, it is expected that the caller has been authenticated in some way (cryptographic signatures, etc). After instantiation, all hashes will be verified on-demand during disk access. If they cannot be verified up to the root node of the tree, the root hash, then the I/O will fail. This should detect tampering with any data on the device and the hash data.

## Rationale

The Container-Optimized OS root filesystem is always mounted as read-only. Additionally, its checksum is computed at build time and verified by the kernel on each boot. This mechanism prevents against attackers from "owning" the machine through permanent local changes.

## Audit Procedure

Verify dm-verity is enabled in kernel config with the following command:

```bash
# zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_DM_VERITY
CONFIG_DM_VERITY=y
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `CONFIG_DM_VERITY=y`.

## Remediation

An OS image update that has the dm-verity enabled kernel is required.

## Additional Information

The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up their start up times. Run `prelink -ua` to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus avoiding false positives from AIDE.
