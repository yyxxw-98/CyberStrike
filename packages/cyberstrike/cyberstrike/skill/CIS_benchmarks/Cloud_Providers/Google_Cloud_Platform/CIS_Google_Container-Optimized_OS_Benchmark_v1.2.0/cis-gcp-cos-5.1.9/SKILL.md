# 5.1.9 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Automated)

## Description

The `HostbasedAuthentication` parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of `.rhosts`, or `/etc/hosts.equiv`, along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.

## Rationale

Even though the `.rhosts` files are ineffective if support is disabled in `/etc/pam.conf`, disabling the ability to use `.rhosts` files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

```bash
# sshd -T | grep hostbasedauthentication

HostbasedAuthentication no
```

## Expected Result

Output should show `HostbasedAuthentication no`.

## Remediation

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameter as follows:

```
HostbasedAuthentication no
```

## Default Value

HostbasedAuthentication no
