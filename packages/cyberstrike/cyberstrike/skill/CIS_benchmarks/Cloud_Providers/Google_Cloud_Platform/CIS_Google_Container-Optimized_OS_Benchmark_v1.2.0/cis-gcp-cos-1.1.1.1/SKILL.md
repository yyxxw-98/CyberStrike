# 1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of udf filesystems is disabled (Automated)

## Description

The `udf` filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA-167 specifications. This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer optical disc formats.

## Rationale

Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

```bash
# modprobe -n -v udf
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep udf
<No output>
```

## Expected Result

- `modprobe -n -v udf` should return `install /bin/true`
- `lsmod | grep udf` should return no output

## Remediation

Edit or create a file in the `/etc/modprobe.d/` directory ending in `.conf`.
Example: `vim /etc/modprobe.d/udf.conf`
and add the following line:

```
install udf /bin/true
```

Run the following command to unload the `udf` module:

```bash
# rmmod udf
```
