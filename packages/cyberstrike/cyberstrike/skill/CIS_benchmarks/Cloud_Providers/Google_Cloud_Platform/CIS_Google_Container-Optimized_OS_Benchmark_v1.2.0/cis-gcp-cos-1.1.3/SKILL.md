# 1.1.3 Ensure nodev option set on /tmp partition (Automated)

## Description

The `nodev` mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

## Rationale

Since the `/tmp` filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in `/tmp`.

## Audit Procedure

Verify that the `nodev` option is set if a `/tmp` partition exists.
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

```bash
# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s' | grep -v nodev
```

## Expected Result

The command should return no output, confirming that the `nodev` option is set on the `/tmp` partition.

## Remediation

Run the following command to remount `/tmp`:

```bash
# mount -o remount,nodev /tmp
```

**Note:** `/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
