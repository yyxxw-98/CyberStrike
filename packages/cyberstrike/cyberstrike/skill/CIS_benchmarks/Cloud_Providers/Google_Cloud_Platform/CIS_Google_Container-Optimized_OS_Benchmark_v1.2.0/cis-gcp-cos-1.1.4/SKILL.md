# 1.1.4 Ensure nosuid option set on /tmp partition (Automated)

## Description

The `nosuid` mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain `setuid` files.

## Rationale

Since the `/tmp` filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot create `setuid` files in `/tmp`.

## Audit Procedure

Verify that the `nosuid` option is set if a `/tmp` partition exists.
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

```bash
# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s' | grep -v nosuid
```

## Expected Result

The command should return no output, confirming that the `nosuid` option is set on the `/tmp` partition.

## Remediation

Run the following command to remount `/tmp`:

```bash
# mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp
```

**Note:** `/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
