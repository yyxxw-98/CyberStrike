# 6.1.5 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd- are configured (Automated)

## Description

The `/etc/passwd-` file contains backup user account information.

## Rationale

It is critical to ensure that the `/etc/passwd-` file is protected from unauthorized access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644` or more restrictive:

```bash
# stat /etc/passwd-
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Expected Result

`Uid` and `Gid` should both be `0/root` and `Access` should be `644` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the following command to set permissions on `/etc/passwd-`:

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/passwd-

# chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/passwd-
```
