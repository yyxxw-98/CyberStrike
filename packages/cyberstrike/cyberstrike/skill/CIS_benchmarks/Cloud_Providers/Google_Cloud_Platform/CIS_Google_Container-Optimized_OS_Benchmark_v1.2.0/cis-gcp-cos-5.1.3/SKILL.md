# 5.1.3 Ensure permissions on SSH public host key files are configured (Automated)

## Description

An SSH public key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this authentication method, a public key is a key that can be used for verifying digital signatures generated using a corresponding private key. Only a public key that corresponds to a private key will be able to authenticate successfully.

## Rationale

If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify Access does not grant write or execute permissions to group or other for all returned files:

```bash
# find /etc/ssh -xdev -type f -name 'ssh_host_*_key.pub' -exec stat {} \;

  File: '/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub'
  Size: 382        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file

```

## Expected Result

- All public host key files have `Uid` of `0/root`
- All public host key files have `Gid` of `0/root`
- Access is `0644/-rw-r--r--` (no write or execute for group or other)

## Remediation

Run the following commands to set permissions and ownership on the SSH host public key files:

```bash
# find /etc/ssh -xdev -type f -name 'ssh_host_*_key.pub' -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
# find /etc/ssh -xdev -type f -name 'ssh_host_*_key.pub' -exec chown root:root {} \;
```
