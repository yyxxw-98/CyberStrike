# 3.2.4 Ensure suspicious packets are logged (Automated)

## Description

When enabled, this feature logs packets with un-routable source addresses to the kernel log.

## Rationale

Enabling this feature and logging these packets allows an administrator to investigate the possibility that an attacker is sending spoofed packets to their system.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

```bash
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1
```

## Expected Result

Both sysctl commands should return a value of `1`, confirming that suspicious (martian) packets are being logged.

## Remediation

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

```bash
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians=1
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
