# 4.1.1.1 Ensure correct container image is set for stackdriver logging agent (Automated)

## Description

`stackdriver-logging` service runs stackdriver container image to export logs to Cloud Logging.

Note: This recommendation is not applicable for COS images using Fluent-bit as it isn't containerized.

## Rationale

If the logging agent is not set correctly, the logs cannot be exported to Cloud Logging.

## Audit Procedure

Verify `LOGGING_AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE` is set to a correct stackdriver container image. Use the following command to verify:

```bash
# grep LOGGING_AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE /etc/stackdriver/env_vars
LOGGING_AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE="gcr.io/stackdriver-agents/stackdriver-logging-agent:<version>"
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `LOGGING_AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE` set to a valid `gcr.io/stackdriver-agents/stackdriver-logging-agent:<version>` image.

## Remediation

Edit the `LOGGING_AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE` variable in the `/etc/stackdriver/env_vars` file to set the correct logging agent.

Run the following command to restart `stackdriver-logging` service:

```bash
# systemctl restart stackdriver-logging
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
