# 3.2.9 Ensure IPv6 router advertisements are not accepted (Automated)

## Description

This setting disables the system's ability to accept IPv6 router advertisements.

## Rationale

It is recommended that systems do not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system (usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

```bash
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0
```

## Expected Result

Both sysctl commands should return a value of `0`, confirming that IPv6 router advertisements are not accepted.

## Remediation

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

```bash
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
