# 6.2.9 Ensure users own their home directories (Automated)

## Description

The user home directory is space defined for the particular user to set local environment variables and to store personal files.

## Rationale

Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be the owner of the directory.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

grep -E -v '^(halt|sync|shutdown)' /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($7 != "'"$(which nologin)"'" && $7 != "/bin/false") { print $1 " " $6 }' | while read user dir; do
  if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
    echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user does not exist."
  else
    owner=$(stat -L -c "%U" "$dir")
    if [ "$owner" != "$user" ]; then
      echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user is owned by $owner."
    fi
  fi
done
```

## Expected Result

No results should be returned.

## Remediation

Change the ownership of any home directories that are not owned by the defined user to the correct user.

## Additional Information

On some distributions the `/sbin/nologin` should be replaced with `/usr/sbin/nologin`.
