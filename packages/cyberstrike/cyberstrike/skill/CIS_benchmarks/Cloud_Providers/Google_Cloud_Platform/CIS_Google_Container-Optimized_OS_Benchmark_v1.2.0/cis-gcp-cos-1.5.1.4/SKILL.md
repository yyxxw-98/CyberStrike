# 1.5.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/motd are configured (Automated)

## Description

The contents of the `/etc/motd` file are displayed to users after login and function as a message of the day for authenticated users.

## Rationale

If the `/etc/motd` file does not have the correct ownership it could be modified by unauthorized users with incorrect or misleading information.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644`:

```bash
# stat /etc/motd
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Expected Result

The output should show `Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)`, `Uid: ( 0/ root)`, and `Gid: ( 0/ root)`.

## Remediation

Run the following commands to set permissions on `/etc/motd`:

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/motd
# chmod 644 /etc/motd
```

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, the steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.
