# 1.4.3 Ensure address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled (Automated)

## Description

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.

## Rationale

Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify output matches:

```bash
# sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

# grep "kernel\.randomize_va_space" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
```

## Expected Result

`kernel.randomize_va_space = 2` should be the output of both commands.

## Remediation

Set the following parameter in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a `/etc/sysctl.d/*` file:

```
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
```

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

```bash
# sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
```
