# 6.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/group are configured (Automated)

## Description

The `/etc/group` file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else.

## Rationale

The `/etc/group` file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged programs.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command and verify `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root` and `Access` is `644`:

```bash
# stat /etc/group
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

## Expected Result

`Uid` and `Gid` should both be `0/root` and `Access` should be `644`.

## Remediation

Run the following command to set permissions on `/etc/group`:

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/group
# chmod 644 /etc/group
```
