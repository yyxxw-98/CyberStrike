# 4.2 Ensure logrotate is configured (Manual)

## Description

The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large.

## Rationale

By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately large log files.

## Audit Procedure

Review `/etc/logrotate.conf` and `/etc/logrotate.d/*` and verify logs are rotated according to site policy.

```bash
# cat /etc/logrotate.conf
# ls /etc/logrotate.d/
```

## Expected Result

The output should show logrotate configuration files with appropriate rotation policies (e.g., daily, weekly, rotate count, compress settings) matching site policy.

## Remediation

Edit `/etc/logrotate.conf` and `/etc/logrotate.d/*` to ensure logs are rotated according to site policy.

`/etc` is stateless on Container-Optimized OS. Therefore, `/etc` cannot be used to make these changes persistent across reboots. The steps mentioned above needs to be performed after every boot.

## Default Value

If no `maxage` setting is set for logrotate a situation can occur where logrotate is interrupted and fails to delete rotated logfiles. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than the longest any log file should exist on your system to ensure that any such logfile is removed but standard rotation settings are not overridden.
