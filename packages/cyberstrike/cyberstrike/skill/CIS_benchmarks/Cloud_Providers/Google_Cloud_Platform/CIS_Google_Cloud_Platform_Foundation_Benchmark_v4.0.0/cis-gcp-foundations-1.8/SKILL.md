# 1.8 Ensure That Separation of Duties Is Enforced While Assigning Service Account Related Roles to Users (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

It is recommended that the principle of 'Separation of Duties' is enforced while assigning service-account related roles to users.

## Rationale

The built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account admin` allows the user/identity to create, delete, and manage service account(s). The built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account User` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on Compute and App Engine) to assign service account(s) to Apps/Compute Instances.

Separation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action. In Cloud IAM - service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to.

Separation of duties is a business control typically used in larger organizations, meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors. It is considered best practice.

No user should have `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles assigned at the same time.

## Impact

The removed role should be assigned to a different user based on business needs.

## Audit Procedure

**From Google Cloud Console**

1. Go to `IAM & Admin/IAM` using `https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam`.
2. Ensure no member has the roles `Service Account Admin` and `Service account User` assigned together.

**From Google Cloud CLI**

1. List all users and role assignments:

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy [Project_ID] --format json | \
  jq -r '[
    (["Service_Account_Admin_and_User"] | (., map(length*"-"))),
      (
        [
          .bindings[] |
          select(.role == "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin" or .role == "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser").members[]
        ] |
        group_by(.) |
        map({User: ., Count: length}) |
        .[] |
        select(.Count == 2).User |
        unique
      )
  ] |
  .[] |
  @tsv'
```

2. All common users listed under `Service_Account_Admin_and_User` are assigned both the `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` and `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` roles.

## Expected Result

No users should be listed as having both `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles assigned simultaneously.

## Remediation

**From Google Cloud Console**

1. Go to `IAM & Admin/IAM` using `https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam`.
2. For any member having both `Service Account Admin` and `Service account User` roles granted/assigned, click the `Delete Bin` icon to remove either role from the member.
   Removal of a role should be done based on the business requirements.

## Default Value

By default, there are no roles assigned to User Managed User created service accounts.

## Additional Information

Users granted with Owner (roles/owner) and Editor (roles/editor) have privileges equivalent to `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User`. To avoid the misuse, Owner and Editor roles should be granted to very limited users and Use of these primitive privileges should be minimal. These requirements are addressed in separate recommendations.
