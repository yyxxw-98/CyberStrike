# 8.1 Ensure That Dataproc Cluster Is Encrypted Using Customer-Managed Encryption Key (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

When you use Dataproc, cluster and job data is stored on Persistent Disks (PDs) associated with the Compute Engine VMs in your cluster and in a Cloud Storage staging bucket. This PD and bucket data is encrypted using a Google-generated data encryption key (DEK) and key encryption key (KEK). The CMEK feature allows you to create, use, and revoke the key encryption key (KEK). Google still controls the data encryption key (DEK).

## Rationale

"Cloud services offer the ability to protect data related to those services using encryption keys managed by the customer within Cloud KMS. These encryption keys are called customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). When you protect data in Google Cloud services with CMEK, the CMEK key is within your control.

## Impact

Using Customer Managed Keys involves additional overhead in maintenance by administrators.

## Audit

### From Google Cloud Console

1. Login to the GCP Console and navigate to the Dataproc Cluster page by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/dataproc/clusters.
2. Select the project from the project dropdown list.
3. On the `Dataproc Clusters` page, select the cluster and click on the Name attribute value that you want to examine.
4. On the `details` page, select the `Configurations` tab.
5. On the `Configurations` tab, check the `Encryption type` configuration attribute value. If the value is set to `Google-managed key`, then Dataproc Cluster is not encrypted with Customer managed encryption keys.

Repeat step no. 3 - 5 for other Dataproc Clusters available in the selected project.

6. Change the project from the project dropdown list and repeat the audit procedure for other projects.

### From Google Cloud CLI

1. Run clusters list command to list all the Dataproc Clusters available in the region:

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters list --region='us-central1'
```

2. Run clusters describe command to get the key details of the selected cluster:

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster_name> --region=us-central1 --flatten=config.encryptionConfig.gcePdKmsKeyName
```

3. If the above command output return "null", then the selected cluster is not encrypted with Customer managed encryption keys.

4. Repeat step no. 2 and 3 for other Dataproc Clusters available in the selected region. Change the region by updating --region and repeat step no. 2 for other clusters available in the project. Change the project by running the below command and repeat the audit procedure for other Dataproc clusters available in other projects:

```bash
gcloud config set project <project_ID>"
```

## Remediation

### From Google Cloud Console

1. Login to the GCP Console and navigate to the Dataproc Cluster page by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/dataproc/clusters.
2. Select the project from the projects dropdown list.
3. On the `Dataproc Cluster` page, click on the `Create Cluster` to create a new cluster with Customer managed encryption keys.
4. On `Create a cluster` page, perform below steps:

- Inside `Set up cluster` section perform below steps:
  - In the `Name` textbox, provide a name for your cluster.
    - From `Location` select the location in which you want to deploy a cluster.
    - Configure other configurations as per your requirements.
- Inside `Configure Nodes` and `Customize cluster` section configure the settings as per your requirements.
- Inside `Manage security` section, perform below steps:
  - From `Encryption`, select `Customer-managed key`.
  - Select a customer-managed key from dropdown list.
  - Ensure that the selected KMS Key have Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role assign to Dataproc Cluster service account ("serviceAccount:service-<project_number>@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com").
  - Click on `Create` to create a cluster.

### From Google Cloud CLI

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters create <cluster_name> --region=us-central1 --gce-pd-kms-key=<key_resource_name>
```

## Default Value

By default, Dataproc Clusters are encrypted using Google-managed key.
