# 1.2 Ensure That Multi-Factor Authentication is Enabled for All Non-Service Accounts (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Setup multi-factor authentication for Google Cloud Platform accounts.

## Rationale

Multi-factor authentication requires more than one mechanism to authenticate a user. This secures user logins from attackers exploiting stolen or weak credentials.

## Impact

None documented.

## Audit Procedure

**From Google Cloud Console**

For each Google Cloud Platform project, folder, or organization:

1. Identify non-service accounts.
2. Manually verify that multi-factor authentication for each account is set.

## Expected Result

All non-service accounts should have multi-factor authentication enabled.

## Remediation

**From Google Cloud Console**

For each Google Cloud Platform project:

1. Identify non-service accounts.
2. Setup multi-factor authentication for each account.

## Default Value

By default, multi-factor authentication is not set.
