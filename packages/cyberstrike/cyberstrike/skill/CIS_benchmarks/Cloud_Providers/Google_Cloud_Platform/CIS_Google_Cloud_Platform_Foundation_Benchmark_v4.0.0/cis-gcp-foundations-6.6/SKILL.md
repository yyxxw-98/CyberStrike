# 6.6 Ensure That Cloud SQL Database Instances Do Not Have Public IPs (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instance to use private IPs instead of public IPs.

## Rationale

To lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IPs. Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.

## Impact

Removing the public IP address on SQL instances may break some applications that relied on it for database connectivity.

## Audit

### From Google Cloud Console

1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances
2. Ensure that every instance has a private IP address and no public IP address configured.

### From Google Cloud CLI

1. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:

```bash
gcloud sql instances list
```

2. For every instance of type `instanceType: CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE` with `backendType: SECOND_GEN`, get detailed configuration. Ignore instances of type `READ_REPLICA_INSTANCE` because these instances inherit their settings from the primary instance. Also, note that first generation instances cannot be configured to have a private IP address.

```bash
gcloud sql instances describe <INSTANCE_NAME>
```

3. Ensure that the setting `ipAddresses` has an IP address configured of `type: PRIVATE` and has no IP address of `type: PRIMARY`. `PRIMARY` IP addresses are public addresses. An instance can have both a private and public address at the same time. Note also that you cannot use private IP with First Generation instances.

## Remediation

### From Google Cloud Console

1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances
2. Click the instance name to open its Instance details page.
3. Select the `Connections` tab.
4. Deselect the `Public IP` checkbox.
5. Click `Save` to update the instance.

### From Google Cloud CLI

1. For every instance remove its public IP and assign a private IP instead:

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --network=<VPC_NETWORK_NAME> --no-assign-ip
```

2. Confirm the changes using the following command:

```bash
gcloud sql instances describe <INSTANCE_NAME>
```

## Prevention

To prevent new SQL instances from getting configured with public IP addresses, set up a `Restrict Public IP access on Cloud SQL instances` Organization policy at: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp.

## Default Value

By default, Cloud Sql instances have a public IP.

## Additional Information

Replicas inherit their private IP status from their primary instance. You cannot configure a private IP directly on a replica.
