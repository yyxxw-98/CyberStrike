# 4.2 Ensure that auditing is enabled

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Audit logging in Cassandra logs every incoming CQL command request, Authentication (successful as well as unsuccessful) to C\* node. Currently, there are two implementations provided, the custom logger can be implemented and injected with the class name as a parameter in cassandra.yaml.

## Rationale

Unauthorized attempts to create, drop or alter users or data should be a concern.

## Audit

Allows logging to filesystem log files using logback or to a Cassandra table. When you turn on audit logging, the default is to write to logback filesystem log files. You can verify auditing is turned on:

```bash
cat cassandra.yaml | grep "audit_logging_options"
```

If failure is enabled: `true` means success
Anything else is a finding.

## Remediation

Open the `cassandra.yaml` file in a text editor.

In the `audit_logging_options` section, set `enabled` to `true`.

```yaml
# Audit logging options
audit_logging_options:
  enabled: true
```

## Default Value

Disabled by default.
