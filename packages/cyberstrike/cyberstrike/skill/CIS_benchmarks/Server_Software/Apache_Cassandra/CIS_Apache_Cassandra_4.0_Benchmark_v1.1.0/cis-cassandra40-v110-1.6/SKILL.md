# 1.6 Ensure clocks are synchronized on all nodes

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Enabling Network Time Protocol (NTP), or some equivalent way, to keep clocks on all nodes in sync is critical.

## Rationale

Cassandra decides which data is most current between all of the nodes in the cluster based on timestamps. It is paramount to ensure all clocks are in-sync, otherwise the most current data may not be returned or worse, marked for deletion.

## Audit

Depending on the Linux installation this may be checked by executing the following command on each node:

```bash
ps -aef | grep ntp

OR

ps -aef | grep chronyd

OR

timedatectl status | grep NTP
```

If NTP is not configured or clocks are out-of-sync then this is a finding.

## Remediation

Install and start the time protocol on every node in the Cassandra cluster.

## Default Value

Varies by system configuration.

## References

None specified in benchmark.

## CIS Controls

**v8:**

- 8.4 Standardize Time Synchronization - Standardize time synchronization. Configure at least two synchronized time sources across enterprise assets, where supported.

**v7:**

- 6.1 Utilize Three Synchronized Time Sources - Use at least three synchronized time sources from which all servers and network devices retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent.
