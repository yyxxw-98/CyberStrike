# Review Superuser/Admin Roles (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra
- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

The `IS_SUPERUSER` privilege found in the `system_auth.roles` table governs who can control the entire Cassandra database and all of its data contained within.

## Rationale

The `IS_SUPERUSER` privilege allows whoever has it to do anything to the data and full administrator rights to the database, including changing passwords, creating, dropping roles. Limiting the accounts that have the `IS_SUPERUSER` role reduces the chances that an attacker can exploit these capabilities.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

Execute the following SQL statement to audit this setting:

```sql
select role, is_superuser from system_auth.roles;
```

Looking for `is_superuser = True`

## Remediation

Perform the following steps to remediate this setting:

Looking at those users from the query that have `is_superuser = True`, decide if that user truly needs that role, if not, for each user, issue the following SQL statement (replace `<role>` with the role name returned from the query):

```sql
alter role <role> with superuser=false;
```

## Default Value

By default, the `cassandra` role has superuser privileges.

## References

None
