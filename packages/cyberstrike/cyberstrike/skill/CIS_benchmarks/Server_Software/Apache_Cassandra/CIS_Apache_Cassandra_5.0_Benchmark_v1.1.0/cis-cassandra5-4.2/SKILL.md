# Ensure that auditing is enabled (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Audit logging in Cassandra logs every incoming CQL command request, Authentication (successful as well as unsuccessful) to C\* node. Currently, there are two implementations provided, the custom logger can be implemented and injected with the class name as a parameter in cassandra.yaml.

## Rationale

Unauthorized attempts to create, drop or alter users or data should be a concern.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

Allows logging to filesystem log files using logback or to a Cassandra table. When you turn on audit logging, the default is to write to logback filesystem log files. You can verify auditing is turned on:

```bash
cat cassandra.yaml | grep -Al "audit_logging_options"
```

If enabled is set to true, then success. Anything else is a finding.

## Remediation

Open the `cassandra.yaml` file in a text editor

In the `audit_logging_options` section, set `enabled` to `true`.

```yaml
# Audit logging options
audit_logging_options:
  enabled: true
```

## Default Value

Auditing is disabled by default.
