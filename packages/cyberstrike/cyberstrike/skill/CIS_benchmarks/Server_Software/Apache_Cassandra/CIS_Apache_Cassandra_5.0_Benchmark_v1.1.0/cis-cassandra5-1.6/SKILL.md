# Ensure clocks are synchronized on all nodes (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Enabling Network Time Protocol (NTP), or some equivalent way, to keep clocks on all nodes in sync is critical.

## Rationale

Cassandra decides which data is most current between all of the nodes in the cluster based on timestamps. It is paramount to ensure all clocks are in-sync, otherwise the most current data may not be returned or worse, marked for deletion.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

Depending on the Linux installation this may be checked by executing the following command on each node:

```bash
ps -aef | grep ntp

OR

ps -aef | grep chronyd

OR

timedatectl status | grep NTP
```

If NTP is not configured or clocks are out-of-sync then this is a finding.

## Remediation

Install and start the time protocol on every node in the Cassandra cluster.

## Default Value

No default value - depends on system configuration.

## References

None
