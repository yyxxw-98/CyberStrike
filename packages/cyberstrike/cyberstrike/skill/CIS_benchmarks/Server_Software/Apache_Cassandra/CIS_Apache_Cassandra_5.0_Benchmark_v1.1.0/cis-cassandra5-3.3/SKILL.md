# Ensure there are no unnecessary roles or excessive privileges (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra
- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Verify each role is require and has only the privileges needed to do its job.

## Rationale

Roles which are unneeded, have super user or other potentially excessive privileges may be an avenue for a hacker to gain access to or modify data in the database.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

As a superuser, retrieve all roles:

```sql
list roles;
```

Retrieve all permissions for all roles:

```sql
select * from system_auth.role_permissions;
```

If there are any unnecessary roles or roles with excessive privileges this is a finding.

## Remediation

Remove any unnecessary roles and/or permissions in accordance with organizational needs.

## Default Value

By default, only the `cassandra` superuser role exists with all permissions.
