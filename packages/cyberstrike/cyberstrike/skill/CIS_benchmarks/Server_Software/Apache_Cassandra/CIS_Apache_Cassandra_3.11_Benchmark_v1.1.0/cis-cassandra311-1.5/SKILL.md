# 1.5 Ensure the Cassandra service is run as a non-root user

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux
- Level 2 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Though Cassandra database may be run as root, it should run as another non-root user.

## Rationale

One of the best ways to reduce your exposure to attack is to create a unique, unprivileged user and group for the server application. A best practice is to follow is ensuring processes run with a user with least privilege.

## Audit

Logon to the server where Cassandra is running and run the following command

```bash
ps -aef | grep cassandra | grep java | cut -d' ' -f1
```

This will show who is running the Cassandra binary.
If the user is root or has excessive privileges then this is a finding.

## Remediation

Create a group for cassandra (if it does not already exist)

```bash
sudo groupadd cassandra
```

Create a user which is only used for running Cassandra and its related processes.

Replacing <DIRECTORY_WHERE_CASSANDRA_INSTALLED> with the full path of where Cassandra binaries are installed.
Replacing <USERID_NUMBER> with a number not already used on the server

## Default Value

No default user exists for running Cassandra.
