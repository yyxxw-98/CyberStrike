# 5.1 Inter-node Encryption

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux
- Level 2 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Cassandra offers the option to encrypt data in transit between nodes on the cluster. By default, inter-node encryption is turned off.

## Rationale

Data being transferred on the wire should be encrypted to avoid network snooping, whether legitimate or not.

## Audit

Run the following command to verify whether inter-node encryption is enabled.

```bash
cat cassandra.yaml | grep -in "internode_encryption:"
```

Acceptable values are all, dc or rack. If the internode_encryption is set to none, this is a finding.

Note: The Cassandra configuration files can be found in the conf directory of tarballs. For packages, the configuration files will be located in /etc/cassandra.

## Remediation

The inter-node encryption should be implemented before anyone accesses the Cassandra server.
To enable the inter-node encryption mechanism:

1. Stop the Cassandra database.
2. If not done so already, build out your keystore and truststore.
3. Modify cassandra.yaml file to modify/add entry for internode_encryption: set it to all
4. Start the Cassandra database.

## Default Value

```
internode_encryption: none
```
