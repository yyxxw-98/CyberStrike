# 4.2 Ensure that auditing is enabled

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux
- Level 2 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Audit logging in Cassandra logs every incoming CQL command request, Authentication (successful as well as unsuccessful login) to C\* node. Currently, there are two implementations provided, the custom logger can be implemented and injected with the class name as parameter in cassandra.yaml.

## Rationale

Unauthorized attempts to create, drop or alter users or data should be a concern.

## Audit

**Open Source Version**
Apache Cassandra versions up to 3.11.4 does not have auditing capabilities, it will be in version 4.x but that has not been released yet according to apache Cassandra website.
https://cassandra.apache.org/download/

**Commercial Version**
Allows via DataStax allows logging to filesystem log files using logback, or to a Cassandra table. When you turn on audit logging, the default is to write to logback filesystem log files. If using DataStax version you can verify auditing is turned on.

```bash
cat dse.yaml | grep "audit_logging_options"
```

If failure is enabled: true means success
Anything else is a finding
