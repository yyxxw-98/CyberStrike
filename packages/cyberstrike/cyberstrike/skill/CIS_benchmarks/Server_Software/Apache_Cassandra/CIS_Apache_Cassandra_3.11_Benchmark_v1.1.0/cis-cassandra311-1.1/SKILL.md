# 1.1 Ensure a separate user and group exist for Cassandra

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux
- Level 2 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

Create separate userid and group for Cassandra.

## Rationale

All processes need to run as a user with least privilege. This mitigates the potential impact of malware to the system.

## Audit

Logon to the server where Cassandra is installed.
To confirm existence of the group, execute the following command:

```bash
$ getent group | grep cassandra
```

To confirm existence of the user, execute the following command:

```bash
$ getent passwd | grep cassandra
```

If either the group or user do not exist, or if the user is not a member of the group, this is a finding.

## Remediation

Create a group for cassandra(if it does not already exist)

```bash
sudo groupadd cassandra
```

Create a user which is only used for running Cassandra and its related processes.

```bash
sudo useradd -m -d /home/cassandra -s /bin/bash -g cassandra -u <USERID_NUMBER> cassandra
```

Replacing <USERID_NUMBER> with a number not already used on the server

## Default Value

No default user or group exists for Cassandra in a fresh installation.

## References
