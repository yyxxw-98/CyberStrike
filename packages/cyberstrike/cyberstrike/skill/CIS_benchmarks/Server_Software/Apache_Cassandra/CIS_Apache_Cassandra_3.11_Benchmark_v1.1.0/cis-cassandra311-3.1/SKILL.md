# 3.1 Ensure the cassandra and superuser roles are separate

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra
- Level 2 - Cassandra
- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux
- Level 2 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

The default installation of Cassandra includes a superuser role named cassandra. This necessitates the creation of a separate role to be the superuser role.

## Rationale

Superuser permissions allow for the creation, deletion, and permission management of other users. Considering the cassandra role is well known it should not be a superuser or one which is used for any administrative tasks.

## Impact

The separate account must be created, assigned the superuser role, and tested for correct functionality prior to removing the superuser role from the cassandra account. Otherwise,

## Audit

To verify the configuration, run the following query:

```sql
select role, is_superuser from system_auth.roles;
```

If cassandra or any unapproved role is returned, this is a finding.

## Remediation

To remediate a misconfiguration, perform the following steps:

1. Execute the following command:

Note: Replace <NEW_ROLE_HERE> with the desired role and <NEW_PASSWORD_HERE> with a password.

2. Verify the new role is working.
3. Remove the superuser role from the cassandra account by executing the following command:

```sql
UPDATE system_auth.roles SET is_superuser=null WHERE role='cassandra'
```

## Default Value

The cassandra role is created with superuser privileges by default.
