# 3.5 Ensure that Cassandra only listens for network connections on authorized interfaces

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Cassandra on Linux

## Description

When `listen_address` is blank and `listen_interface` is commented out, this will be set automatically by `InetAddress.getLocalHost()`. Presuming the node is configured correctly, e.g. hostname, name resolution, etc., this will configure the node to use the address associated with the hostname. The `listen_address` must not be set to `0.0.0.0`.

## Rationale

Setting the address or interface to bind to will tell other Cassandra nodes to which address or interface to connect. This must be changed from the default in order for multiple nodes to be able to communicate.

## Audit

Check the value of `listen_address` or `listen_interface` in the `cassandra.yaml`. If `listen_address` is set `0.0.0.0` or a non-authorized address or interface is specified, this is a finding.

Run these command to assist:

```bash
cat cassandra.yaml | grep -in "listen_address:" | grep "0.0.0.0"
cat cassandra.yaml | grep -in "listen_address:"
cat cassandra.yaml | grep -in "listen_interface:"
```

## Remediation

Set the `listen_address` or `listen_interface`, not both, in the `cassandra.yaml` to an authorized address or interface.

## Default Value

```
listen_address: localhost

listen_interface: eth0, but is commented out by default.
```
