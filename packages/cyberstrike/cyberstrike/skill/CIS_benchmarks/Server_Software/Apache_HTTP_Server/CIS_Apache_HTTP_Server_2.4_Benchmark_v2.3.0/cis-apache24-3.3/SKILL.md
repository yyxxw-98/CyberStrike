# 3.3 Ensure the Apache User Account Is Locked

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The user account under which Apache runs should not have a valid password, but should be locked.

## Rationale

As a defense-in-depth measure the Apache user account should be locked to prevent logins, and to prevent a user from su'ing to `apache` using the password. In general, there shouldn't be a need for anyone to have to su as `apache`, and when there is a need, then `sudo` should be used instead, which would not require the `apache` account password.

## Audit

Ensure the `apache` account is locked using the following:

```bash
# passwd -S apache
```

The results will be similar to the following:

```
apache LK 2010-01-28 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)

- or -

apache L 07/02/2012 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

## Remediation

Use the `passwd` command to lock the `apache` account:

```bash
# passwd -l apache
```

## Default Value

The default user is `daemon` and the account is typically locked.
