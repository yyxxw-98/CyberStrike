# Ensure Access to .ht\* Files Is Restricted (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

Level 1

## Description

Restrict access to any files beginning with `.ht` using the `FilesMatch` directive.

## Rationale

The default name for access filename which allows files in web directories to override the Apache configuration is `.htaccess`. The usage of access files should not be allowed, but as a defense in depth a `FilesMatch` directive is recommended to prevent web clients from viewing those files in case they are created. Also a common name for web password and group files are `.htpasswd` and `.htgroup`. Neither of these files should be placed in the document root, but, in the event they are, the `FilesMatch` directive can be used to prevent them from being viewed by web clients.

## Impact

`.ht*` files are not accessible.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following steps to determine if the recommended state is implemented:

Verify that a `FilesMatch` directive similar to the one below is present in the apache configuration and not commented out. The deprecated `Deny from All` directive may be used instead of the Require directive.

```
<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
```

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

Add or modify the following lines in the Apache configuration file at the server configuration level.

```
<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
```

## Default Value

`.ht*` files are not accessible.
