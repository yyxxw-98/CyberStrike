# 5.8 Ensure the HTTP TRACE Method Is Disabled

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Use the Apache `TraceEnable` directive to disable the HTTP `TRACE` request method.

## Rationale

The HTTP 1.1 protocol requires support for the `TRACE` request method which reflects the request back as a response and was intended for diagnostics purposes. The `TRACE` method is not needed and is easily subjected to abuse and should be disabled.

## Audit

Perform the following to determine if the recommended state is implemented:

1. Locate the Apache configuration files and included configuration files.
2. Verify there is a single `TraceEnable` directive configured with a value of `off`.

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

1. Locate the main Apache configuration file such as `httpd.conf`.
2. Add a `TraceEnable` directive to the server level configuration with a value of `off`. Server level configuration is the top-level configuration, not nested within any other directives like `<Directory>` or `<Location>`.

## Default Value

The `TRACE` method is enabled.
