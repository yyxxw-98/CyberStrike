# Ensure KeepAlive Is Enabled (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `KeepAlive` directive controls whether Apache will reuse the same TCP connection per client to process subsequent HTTP requests from that client. It is recommended that the `KeepAlive` directive be set to `On`.

## Rationale

Allowing per-client reuse of TCP sockets reduces the amount of system and network resources required to serve requests. This efficiency gain may improve a server's resiliency to DoS attacks.

## Audit

Perform the following steps to determine if the recommended state is implemented: Verify that the `KeepAlive` directive in the Apache configuration to have a value of `On`, or is not present. If the directive is not present the default value is `On`.

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the recommended state: Add or modify the `KeepAlive` directive in the Apache configuration to have a value of `On`, so that `KeepAlive` connections are enabled.

```apache
KeepAlive On
```

## Default Value

```apache
KeepAlive On
```
