# 3.9 Ensure the Pid File Is Secured

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `PidFile` directive sets the file path to the process ID file to which the server records the process id of the server, which is useful for sending a signal to the server process or for checking on the health of the process.

## Rationale

If the `PidFile` is placed in a writable directory, other accounts could create a denial of service attack and prevent the server from starting by creating a PID file with the same name.

## Audit

1. Find the directory in which the `PidFile` would be created. The default value is the `ServerRoot/logs` directory.
2. Verify that the process ID file directory is not a directory within the Apache `DocumentRoot`
3. Verify that the ownership and group of the directory is `root:root` (or the user under which Apache initially starts up if not `root`).
4. Verify the permissions on the directory are only writable by root (or the startup user if not `root`).

## Remediation

1. Find the directory in which the `PidFile` would be created. The default value is the `ServerRoot/logs` directory.
2. Modify the directory if the `PidFile` is in a directory within the Apache `DocumentRoot`.
3. Change the ownership and group to be `root:root`, if not already.
4. Change the permissions so that the directory is only writable by root, or the user under which Apache initially starts up (default is root).

## Default Value

The default process ID file is `logs/httpd.pid`.
