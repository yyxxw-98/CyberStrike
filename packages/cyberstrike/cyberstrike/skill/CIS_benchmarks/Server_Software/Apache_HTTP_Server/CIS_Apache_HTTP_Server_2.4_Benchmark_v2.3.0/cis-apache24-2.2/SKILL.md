# 2.2 Ensure the Log Config Module Is Enabled (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `log_config` module provides for flexible logging of client requests, and provides for the configuration of the information in each log.

## Rationale

Logging is critical for monitoring usage and potential abuse of your web server. This module is required to configure web server logging using the `log_format` directive.

## Audit

Perform the following to determine if the `log_config` has been loaded:

Use the `httpd -M` option as root to check that the module is loaded.

```bash
# httpd -M | grep log_config
```

**Note**: If the module is correctly enabled, the output will include the module name and whether it is loaded statically or as a shared module

## Remediation

Perform either one of the following:

- For source builds with static modules, run the Apache `./configure` script without including the `--disable-log-config` script options.
  - `$ cd $DOWNLOAD_HTTPD`
  - `$ ./configure`
- For dynamically loaded modules, add or modify the LoadModule directive so that it is present in the apache configuration as below and not commented out:
  - `LoadModule log_config_module modules/mod_log_config.so`

## Default Value

The `log_config` module is loaded by default.
