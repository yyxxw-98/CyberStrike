# Ensure MaxKeepAliveRequests Is Set Properly

## Description

The `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directive limits the number of requests allowed per connection when `KeepAlive` is on. If it is set to `0`, unlimited requests will be allowed. It is recommended that the `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directive be set to `100` or greater.

## Rationale

Limiting the number of requests per connection may improve a server's resiliency to DoS attacks.

## Impact

None documented

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following steps to determine if the recommended state is implemented:

Verify that the `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directive in the Apache configuration either has a value of `100` or more or is not present. If the directive is not present, the default value is `100`.

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

Add or modify the `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directive in the Apache configuration to have a value of `100` or more.

```
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
```

## Default Value

```
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
```
