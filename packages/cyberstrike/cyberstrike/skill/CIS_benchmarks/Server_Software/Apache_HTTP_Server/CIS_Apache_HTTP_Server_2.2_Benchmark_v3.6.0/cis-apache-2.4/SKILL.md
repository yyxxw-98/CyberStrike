# Ensure the Status Module Is Disabled

## Description

The Apache `mod_status` module provides current server performance statistics.

## Rationale

While having server performance status information available as a web page may be convenient, it's recommended that this module be disabled. When it is enabled, its handler capability is available in all configuration files, including per-directory files (e.g., `.htaccess`). This may have security-related ramifications.

## Impact

None documented

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following to determine if the `mod_status` module is disabled.

Run the `httpd` server with the `-M` option to list enabled modules:

```bash
# httpd -M | egrep 'status_module'
```

**Note**: If the modules are correctly disabled, the only output when executing the above command should be `Syntax OK`.

## Remediation

Perform either one of the following to disable the `mod_status` module:

1. For source builds with static modules, run the Apache `./configure` script with the `--disable-status configure` script options.

```bash
$ cd $DOWNLOAD/httpd-2.2.22
$ ./configure --disable-status
```

2. For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the `LoadModule` directive for the `mod_status` module from the `httpd.conf` file.

```bash
##LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
```

## Default Value

The module is enabled with a default source build.
