# Ensure KeepAlive Is Enabled

## Description

The `KeepAlive` directive controls whether Apache will reuse the same TCP connection per client to process subsequent HTTP requests from that client. It is recommended that the `KeepAlive` directive be set to `On`.

## Rationale

Allowing per-client reuse of TCP sockets reduces the amount of system and network resources required to serve requests. This efficiency gain may improve a server's resiliency to DoS attacks.

## Impact

None documented

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following steps to determine if the recommended state is implemented:

Verify that the `KeepAlive` directive in the Apache configuration either has a value of `On` or is not present. If the directive is not present, the default value is `On`.

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

Add or modify the `KeepAlive` directive in the Apache configuration to have a value of `On`.

```
KeepAlive On
```

## Default Value

```
KeepAlive On
```
