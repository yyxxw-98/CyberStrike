# CIS 5.3.1 — Ensure X-Content-Type-Options header is configured and enabled

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Webserver

## Description

The `X-Content-Type-Options` header instructs the browser to strictly follow the MIME types declared in the `Content-Type` headers and **not to guess ("sniff") the content type based on the file's actual content**.

## Rationale

Implementing the `X-Content-Type-Options` header with the `nosniff` directive helps to prevent drive-by download attacks where a user agent is sniffing content types in responses.

This header prevents "MIME type confusion" attacks. Without this header, browsers might interpret a file declared as text (e.g., `snippet.txt`) as executable if it contains script code. Setting the `nosniff` directive **forces the browser to reject the file if the declared type doesn't match the context in which it's loaded** (e.g., loading a text file as a script).

## Impact

**Low Risk:** In rare cases, legacy applications or misconfigured servers might rely on the browser's ability to correct wrong Content-Type headers (e.g., serving JavaScript with a `text/plain` header). Enabling `nosniff` will break these applications because the browser will refuse to execute the script. Ensuring correct MIME types in the NGINX configuration (`mime.types`) is a prerequisite.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command to inspect the fully loaded NGINX configuration:

```bash
nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -i 'X-Content-Type-Options'
```

**Verify the output:**

- Verify that the configuration contains the line: `add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;`
- Specifically check for the `always` parameter at the end of the directive. Without it, the header will be missing on error pages.

## Remediation

Open the NGINX configuration file that contains your `server` blocks. Add the below line into your `server` block to add `X-Content-Type-Options` header and direct your user agent to **not** sniff content types.

```nginx
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
```

## Default Value

This header is not implemented by default.

## Additional Information

The `always` parameter ensures that the header is applied to the HTTP **response** no matter what the HTTP response code is.
