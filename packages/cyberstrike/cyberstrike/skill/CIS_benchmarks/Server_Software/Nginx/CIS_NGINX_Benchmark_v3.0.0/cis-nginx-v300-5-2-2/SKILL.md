# CIS 5.2.2 — Ensure the maximum request body size is set correctly

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Webserver
- Level 1 - Proxy
- Level 1 - Loadbalancer

## Description

The `client_max_body_size` directive defines the maximum permissible size for a client request body, as indicated by the `Content-Length` header. If a request exceeds this size, NGINX will immediately reject it with a `413 Request Entity Too Large` error, preventing the oversized request from being processed further or passed to a backend application.

## Rationale

Limiting the request body size is a crucial defense against resource exhaustion DoS attacks and prevents oversized, potentially malicious payloads from reaching application backends. By setting a logical default limit and only increasing it for specific application endpoints that require it (e.g., file uploads), the principle of least functionality is enforced, significantly reducing the attack surface.

## Impact

Setting this value too low is a common cause of application failure. Legitimate user actions, such as uploading files or submitting large forms, will be blocked with a `413` error **if** they exceed the configured limit. It is essential that this value is determined based on application requirements and not set to an arbitrary low number.

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command to inspect the fully loaded NGINX configuration for the `client_max_body_size` directive:

```bash
nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^\s*(client_max_body_size)'
```

Verify that a global `client_max_body_size` is set in the `http` block. For any location blocks that override this value (e.g., for uploads), **manually** verify that the increased limit is documented and aligns with the application's functional requirements.

## Remediation

Define a restrictive global limit in the `http` block. For specific application endpoints that need to accept larger request bodies, override this directive within the corresponding `location` block.

**Example Configuration:**

```nginx
http {

    # Set a restrictive global default of 2 Megabytes. This prevents
    # unexpected large requests on most endpoints.
    client_max_body_size 2M;

    server {
        # ...

        # This location handles API requests with potentially large JSON payloads.
        location /api/v1/data {
            client_max_body_size 10M; # Allow up to 10MB
            # ...
        }

        # This location is for large file uploads.
        location /uploads {
            client_max_body_size 50M; # Allow up to 50MB
            # ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Default Value

The default value is 1 megabyte (`1m`). It's recommended to set this value **explicitly** in the `http` block to serve as a documented, global default. For many API endpoints or static content locations, even this default may be more permissive than necessary.
