# CIS 2.1.1 — Ensure only required dynamic modules are loaded

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Webserver
- Level 1 - Proxy
- Level 1 - Loadbalancer

## Description

NGINX functionality is provided by modules. These modules are either compiled statically into the NGINX binary or loaded dynamically at runtime via the `load_module` directive.

- **Static Modules:** These are fixed at compile time. When using official pre-built packages (e.g., from nginx.org or OS vendors), a standard set of modules is included and cannot be removed without recompiling NGINX.
- **Dynamic Modules:** These are separate `.so` files that can be loaded on demand. To reduce the attack surface and complexity, only strictly required **dynamic modules** should be loaded. Additionally, administrators should be aware of the active **static modules** to avoid configuring unused features unintentionally.

## Rationale

Minimizing the loaded code reduces the potential attack surface. While static modules in pre-built packages cannot be removed, ensuring that no unnecessary **dynamic modules** are loaded prevents the execution of unneeded code. Furthermore, understanding which **static modules** are present helps administrators avoid enabling risky features (like `autoindex` or `stub_status`) in the configuration if they are not needed.

## Impact

Removing a required dynamic module or misinterpreting the availability of a static module can cause the NGINX service to fail on restart or break specific application features.

## Audit Procedure

**1. Audit Dynamic Modules (Actionable):**

Run the following command to check for actively loaded dynamic modules:

```bash
nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep "load_module"
```

**Evaluation:**

- If the output is empty, no dynamic modules are loaded (PASS).
- If output exists (e.g., `load_module modules/ngx_http_geoip_module.so;`), verify that each listed module is required for the application's business logic.

**2. Audit Static Modules (Informational):**

Run the following command to list all modules compiled into the binary:

```bash
nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -oEi '\-\-(with|without)-[^ ]*'
```

**Evaluation:**

Review the `--with-...` flags to understand the server's capabilities. Ensure that risky modules present in the build (e.g., `http_stub_status_module`) are not enabled in any `server` or `location` block **unless authorized**.

## Remediation

**For Dynamic Modules:**

Open the main configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) or the relevant include file (e.g., in `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled/`). Comment out or remove the `load_module` directive for any module **that is not strictly necessary**.

**For Static Modules:**

Since static modules cannot be removed from pre-built packages, ensure their directives are not used in your configuration. If a specific static module poses a critical risk to your environment, you must switch to a custom build or a different package flavor that excludes it.

## Default Value

Official pre-built packages (like `nginx-stable` or `nginx-mainline`) are "feature-rich" builds containing most standard modules statically. This is a trade-off for ease of maintenance. Security hardening for these packages relies on configuration discipline (not enabling unused modules) rather than binary minimization.
