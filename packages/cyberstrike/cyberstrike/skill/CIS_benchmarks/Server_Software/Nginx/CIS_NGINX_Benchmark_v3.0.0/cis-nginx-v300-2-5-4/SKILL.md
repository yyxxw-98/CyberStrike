# CIS 2.5.4 — Ensure the NGINX reverse proxy does not enable information disclosure

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Proxy
- Level 1 - Loadbalancer

## Description

When NGINX acts as a reverse proxy, it forwards headers sent by the upstream application (e.g., `"X-Powered-By: Custom_APP"` or `"Server: Apache/2.4"`). These headers should be stripped before the response reaches the client to prevent information disclosure about the backend infrastructure.

## Rationale

Attackers conduct reconnaissance by inspecting response headers to identify the technologies used in the backend (e.g., specific versions of PHP, Java/Tomcat, or Python frameworks). Knowing the exact version allows attackers to target specific CVEs associated with that software stack. Removing these headers reduces the information available for targeted attacks.

## Impact

Removing upstream headers may affect debugging or monitoring tools that rely on these headers. Ensure that any required headers are logged internally before being stripped.

## Audit Procedure

**1. Configuration Check:**

Search the loaded configuration for header hiding directives:

```bash
nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei "(proxy|fastcgi)_hide_header"
```

**Evaluation:**

- Verify that directives exist to hide `X-Powered-By` and `Server`.

**2. Functional Check (Recommended):**

Send a request to a proxied endpoint and inspect the response headers:

```bash
curl -k -I https://127.0.0.1 | grep -Ei "^(Server|X-Powered-By)"
```

**Evaluation:**

- **PASS:** The output does not contain backend details (e.g., `X-Powered-By: PHP/8.2`). If Server is present, it should only be `Server: nginx` (controlled by Control 2.5.1).
- **FAIL:** The output contains backend information or unmasked version numbers.

## Remediation

Configure NGINX to strip the sensitive headers. The directive depends on the upstream protocol (HTTP Proxy vs. FastCGI).

**For Standard Reverse Proxy (`proxy_pass`):**

Add the following directives to your `http`, `server`, or `location` block:

```nginx
proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
proxy_hide_header Server;
```

**For PHP/FastCGI (`fastcgi_pass`):**

If you are using FastCGI (e.g., for PHP-FPM), use the `fastcgi_hide_header` directive instead:

```nginx
fastcgi_hide_header X-Powered-By;
```

## Default Value

By default, NGINX passes all headers received from the upstream server to the client unchanged.
