# CIS 4.1.6 — Ensure awareness of TLS 1.3 new Diffie-Hellman parameters

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Webserver
- Level 1 - Proxy
- Level 1 - Loadbalancer

## Description

This control is not applicable to environments exclusively using TLS 1.3.

## Rationale

The TLS 1.3 protocol (RFC 8446) deprecates the use of custom finite-field Diffie-Hellman (DHE) groups, which were configured via the `ssl_dhparam` directive in NGINX. Instead, TLS 1.3 exclusively uses a set of pre-defined, standardized, and secure elliptic curve (ECDHE) and finite-field (FFDHE) groups for its key exchange mechanism. This design eliminates the risk associated with weak or misconfigured custom DH parameters. As such, the `ssl_dhparam` directive has no effect in a TLS 1.3-only configuration.

## Impact

None for a TLS 1.3-only configuration.

## Audit Procedure

Verify that the configuration does not rely on TLS 1.2 **or older protocols** that would require this setting. This control is implicitly passed if control 4.1.4 ("Ensure only modern TLS protocols are used") is configured for TLS 1.3 exclusively.

## Remediation

No remediation is necessary. Ensure `ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;` is set. The `ssl_dhparam` directive should be removed as it is obsolete.

## Default Value

Not applicable for TLS 1.3-only configurations.
