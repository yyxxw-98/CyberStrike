# CIS 2.4.4 — Ensure send_timeout is set to 10 seconds or less, but not 0

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Webserver
- Level 1 - Proxy
- Level 1 - Loadbalancer

## Description

The `send_timeout` directive sets a timeout for transmitting a response to the client between two successive write operations.

## Rationale

Setting the `send_timeout` directive on the server side helps mitigate slow HTTP denial of service attacks by ensuring write operations taking up large amounts of time are closed.

## Impact

Setting the `send_timeout` to a low value may impact clients with slow connections or applications that stream large responses.

## Audit Procedure

To check the current setting for the `send_timeout` directive, issue the below command. You should also manually check your nginx configuration for include statements that may be located outside the `/etc/nginx` directory. If none of these are present, the value is set at the default.

```bash
grep -ir send_timeout /etc/nginx
```

The output of the command should be similar to the following:

```nginx
send_timeout  10;
```

## Remediation

Find the `HTTP` or `server` block of your nginx configuration, and add the `send_timeout` directive. Set it to `10` seconds or less, but not `0`.

```nginx
send_timeout    10;
```

## Default Value

```nginx
send_timeout 60s;
```
