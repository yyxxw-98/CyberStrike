# 2.2.1 Ensure access to OCI Audit service Log for OKE (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The audit logs are part of the OKE managed Kubernetes control plane logs managed by OKE. OKE integrates with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit Service.

All operations performed by the Kubernetes API server are visible as log events on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service.

## Rationale

Logging is a crucial detective control for all systems to detect potential unauthorized access.

## Impact

The Control plane audit logs are managed by OKE. OKE Control plane logs are written to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit Service. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service automatically records calls to all supported Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public application programming interface (API) endpoints as log events.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

To monitor and manage operations performed by Container Engine for Kubernetes on a particular cluster:

1. In the Console, open the navigation menu. Under Solutions and Platform, go to Developer Services and click Kubernetes Clusters.
2. Choose a Compartment you have permission to work in.
3. On the Cluster List page, click the cluster's name for which you want to monitor and manage operations.
4. The Cluster page shows information about the cluster.
5. Display the Work Requests tab, showing the recent operations performed on the cluster.

To view operations performed by Container Engine for Kubernetes and the Kubernetes API server as log events in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service:

1. In the Console, open the navigation menu. Under Governance and Administration, go to Governance and click Audit.
2. Choose a Compartment you have permission to work in.
3. Search and filter to show the operations you're interested in:

- To view operations performed by Container Engine for Kubernetes, enter `ClustersAPI` in the Keywords field and click Search.
- To view operations performed by the Kubernetes API server, enter `OKE API Server Admin Access` in the Keywords field and click Search.

## Remediation

No remediation is necessary for this control.

## Default Value

By default, Kubernetes API server logs and Container Engine for Kubernetes audit events are sent to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service. By default, the Audit Log retention period is 90 days.
