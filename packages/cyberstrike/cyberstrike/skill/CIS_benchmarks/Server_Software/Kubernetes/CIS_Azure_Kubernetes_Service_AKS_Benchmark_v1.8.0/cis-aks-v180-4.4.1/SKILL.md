# 4.4.1 Ensure latest CNI version is used (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

There are a variety of CNI plugins available for Kubernetes. If the CNI in use does not support Network Policies it may not be possible to effectively restrict traffic in the cluster.

## Rationale

Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies.

## Impact

None.

## Audit

Ensure CNI plugin supports network policies.

Set Environment Variables to run:

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP=Resource Group Name
export CLUSTER_NAME=Cluster Name
```

Azure command to check for CNI plugin:

```bash
az aks show --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --query "networkProfile"
```

## Remediation

As with RBAC policies, network policies should adhere to the policy of least privileged access. Start by creating a deny all policy that restricts all inbound and outbound traffic from a namespace or create a global policy using Cilium or Calico.

## Default Value

This will depend on the CNI plugin in use.

## Additional Information

One example here is Flannel (https://github.com/coreos/flannel) which does not support Network policy unless Calico is also in use.
