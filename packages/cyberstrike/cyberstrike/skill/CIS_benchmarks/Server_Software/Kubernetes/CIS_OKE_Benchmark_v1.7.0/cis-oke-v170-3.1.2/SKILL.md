# CIS OKE Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 3.1.2

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

If `kubelet` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubelet-config.json file is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The kubelet-config.json file for `kubelet` controls various parameters for the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

### Method 1

SSH to the worker nodes. To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status kubelet
```

The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`.

Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubelet-config.json file:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kubelet
```

The output of the above command should return something similar to `--kubeconfig /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the kubelet-config.json file.

Run this command to obtain the kubelet-config.json file ownership:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-config.json
```

The output of the above command gives you the kubelet-config.json file's ownership. Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

### Method 2

Create and Run a Privileged Pod. You will need to run a pod that is privileged enough to access the host's file system. This can be achieved by deploying a pod that uses the hostPath volume to mount the node's file system into the pod.

Here's an example of a simple pod definition that mounts the root of the host to /host within the pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: file-check
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: host-root
      hostPath:
        path: /
        type: Directory
  containers:
    - name: nsenter
      image: busybox
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: host-root
          mountPath: /host
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
```

Save this to a file (e.g., file-check-pod.yaml) and create the pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f file-check-pod.yaml
```

Once the pod is running, you can exec into it to check file ownership on the node:

```bash
kubectl exec -it file-check -- sh
```

Now you are in a shell inside the pod, but you can access the node's file system through the /host directory and check the ownership of the file:

```bash
ls -l /host/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-config.json
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```bash
chown root:root <kubelet-config.json file>
```

## Default Value

See the OKE documentation for the default value.
