# CIS OKE Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 4.3.1

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

There are a variety of CNI plugins available for Kubernetes. If the CNI in use does not support Network Policies it may not be possible to effectively restrict traffic in the cluster.

## Rationale

Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

Review the documentation of CNI plugin in use by the cluster, and confirm that it supports network policies.

Check the DaemonSets in the kube-system namespace: Many CNI plugins operate as DaemonSets within the kube-system namespace. To see what's running:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset -n kube-system
```

Look for known CNI providers like Calico, Flannel, Cilium, etc.

You can further inspect the configuration of these DaemonSets to understand more about the CNI setup:

```bash
kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name> -n kube-system
```

Check the CNI Configuration Files: If you have access to the nodes (via SSH), you can check the CNI configuration directly in /etc/cni/net.d/. This often requires node-level access, which might not be available depending on your permissions and the security setup of your environment.

## Remediation

As with RBAC policies, network policies should adhere to the policy of least privileged access. Start by creating a deny all policy that restricts all inbound and outbound traffic from a namespace or create a global policy using Calico.

## Default Value

This will depend on the CNI plugin in use.

## Additional Information

One example here is Flannel (https://github.com/coreos/flannel) which does not support Network policy unless Calico is also in use.
