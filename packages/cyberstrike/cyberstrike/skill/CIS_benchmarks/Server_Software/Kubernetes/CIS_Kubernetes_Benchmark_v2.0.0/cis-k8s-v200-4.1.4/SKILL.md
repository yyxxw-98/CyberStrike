# 4.1.4 If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure ownership is set to root:root (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Worker Node

## Description

If `kube-proxy` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The kubeconfig file for `kube-proxy` controls various parameters for the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Find the kubeconfig file being used by `kube-proxy` by running the following command:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-proxy
```

If `kube-proxy` is running, get the kubeconfig file location from the `--kubeconfig` parameter.

To perform the audit:

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```bash
stat -c %U:%G <path><filename>
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```bash
chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>
```

## Default Value

By default, `proxy` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
