# 4.1.5 Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Worker Node

## Description

Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Rationale

The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the `<PATH>/<FILENAME>` of the kubelet config file.

Please set `$kubelet_config=<PATH><filename>` based on the file location on your system.

For example:

```bash
export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```

To perform the audit manually: Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`. Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
```

## Default Value

By default, `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `600`.
