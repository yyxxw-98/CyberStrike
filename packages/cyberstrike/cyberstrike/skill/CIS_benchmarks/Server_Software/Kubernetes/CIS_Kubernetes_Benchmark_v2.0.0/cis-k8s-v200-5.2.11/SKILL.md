# 5.2.11 Minimize the admission of HostPath volumes (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Do not generally admit containers which make use of `hostPath` volumes.

## Rationale

A container which mounts a `hostPath` volume as part of its specification will have access to the filesystem of the underlying cluster node. The use of `hostPath` volumes may allow containers access to privileged areas of the node filesystem.

There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to mount `hostPath` volumes.

If you need to run containers which require `hostPath` volumes, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.

## Impact

Pods defined which make use of `hostPath` volumes will not be permitted unless they are run under a specific policy.

## Audit

List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows the admission of containers with `hostPath` volumes.

## Remediation

Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers which use `hostPath` volumes.

## Default Value

By default, there are no restrictions on the creation of `hostPath` volumes.
