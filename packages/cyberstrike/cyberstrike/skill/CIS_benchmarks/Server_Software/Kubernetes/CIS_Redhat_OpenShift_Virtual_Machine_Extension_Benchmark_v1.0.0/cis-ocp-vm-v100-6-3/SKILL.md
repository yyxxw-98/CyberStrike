# CIS 6.3 — Ensure all CPU vulnerabilities are mitigated

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Ensure that all known CPU vulnerabilities are mitigated. This ensures that known attacks, such as Spectre, Meltdown, etc. either do not affect the node or are mitigated via software.

## Rationale

Vulnerability mitigation ensures that known attacks cannot be exploited.

## Impact

Impact analysis should be performed on a per-mitigation basis.

## Audit Procedure

View CPU mitigations:

```
$ ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities
```

Output may resemble the following:

```
"Not affected"    CPU is not affected by the vulnerability
"Vulnerable"      CPU is affected and no mitigation in effect
"Mitigation: $M"  CPU is affected and mitigation $M is in effect
```

## Remediation

Add the appropriate kernel arguments to the MachineConfigPools of the workers nodes and reboot them. See Documentation Chapter 1.Customizing nodes | Red Hat Product Documentation

## Default Value

The cpu vulnerabilities file is not populated by default

## References

None listed in the PDF.
