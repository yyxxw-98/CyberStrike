# CIS 1.2 — Enable nonRoot feature gate in OCPvirt prior to 4.18

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Root is a default account with elevated privileges, including full administrative access to both security and non-security related functions. The "nonRoot" feature gate in OpenShift environments ensures virtual machine access is restricted to resources and functionality required to operate.

## Rationale

Unauthorized access to a root account without restrictions implemented by the nonRoot feature introduces the risk of unintended or unauthorized access to privilege elevation and the ability to perform administrative tasks. This feature is a foundational mechanism in implementing role and attribute based access controls.

## Impact

Disabling root introduces the need to implement alternate identification and authentication methods to access administrative functions.

## Audit Procedure

Use the following command to list nonRoot settings for hyper converged resources:

```bash
$ oc get hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv -ojsonpath='{.spec.featureGates.nonRoot}'
```

Verify the output is `true`. nonRoot is deprecated in Openshift Virtualization from 4.18, and the secure default is enforced.

## Remediation

Enable `nonRoot` and set its value to `True`.

```bash
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type='json' -p='[
    {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/featureGates/nonRoot", "value": true },
]'
```

## Default Value

By default, KubeVirt workloads run in nonRoot mode and it sets to `false`. From 4.18, this field will be ignored, and always be enabled.
