# CIS 1.1 — Restrict GPU and USB pass through to approved devices

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The ability to pass through devices provides the capability to offload tasks from the CPU to the device itself.

## Rationale

Restricting passthrough to approved devices reduces the risk of unauthorized or unintended data sharing/transmission introduced by allowing GPU and USB connectivity.

## Impact

Unauthorized devices will not be passed through, and therefore not be available to workloads.

## Audit Procedure

List the host devices available to virtualization workloads and verify the host devices returned are necessary for workload execution.

```bash
$ oc get hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv -ojsonpath='{.spec.permittedHostDevices}'
```

Example output structure:

```json
{
  "mediatedDevices": [
    {
      "mdevNameSelector": "DEVICE_A",
      "resourceName": "vendor.com/DEVICE_A"
    }
  ],
  "pciHostDevices": [
    {
      "externalResourceProvider": true,
      "pciDeviceSelector": "XXX:YYY",
      "resourceName": "vendor.com/DEVICE_B"
    },
    {
      "pciDeviceSelector": "NNN:MMM",
      "resourceName": "vendor.com/DEVICE_C"
    }
  ],
  "usbHostDevices": [
    {
      "resourceName": "kubevirt.io/storage",
      "selectors": [
        {
          "product": "0001",
          "vendor": "46f4"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remediation

Enforcing limitations to the passthrough of approved devices protects against the introduction of a malicious or unknown device to the system. The system administrator can remove the unwanted devices by patching the HCO object.

If the first PCI device (the DEVICE_A at index 0) should not be permitted to be passed through to a VM, here's how to remove it:

```bash
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type='json' -p='[
    {"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/permittedHostDevices/pciHostDevices/0"},
]'
```

To remove all permitted devices, use the following:

```bash
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type='json' -p='[
    {"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/permittedHostDevices"},
]'
```

## Default Value

By default, OpenShift Virtualization doesn't configure any pass through devices. The result of the command should be empty.
