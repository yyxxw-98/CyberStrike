# CIS 1.7 — Ensure KSM is disabled

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) is a Linux kernel feature that merges identical memory pages across virtual machines running on a single host, potentially reducing memory usage and improving system performance.

## Rationale

Sharing resources introduces the risk of memory corruption attacks, unauthorized or unintended sharing of information, and the manipulation of data flow restrictions.

## Impact

Disabling Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) does not impact normal node operations. Workloads requiring a high amount of memory usage could potentially see an impact on system performance.

## Audit Procedure

Use the following command to list KSM configuration for hyperconverged resources:

```bash
$ oc get hyperconvergeds kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv -ojsonpath='{.spec.ksmConfiguration}'
```

## Remediation

Disable the KSM feature. For example, by directly editing the object with `oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv` and set the field to `false`.

## Default Value

KSM is disabled by default. The command should return `false`.
