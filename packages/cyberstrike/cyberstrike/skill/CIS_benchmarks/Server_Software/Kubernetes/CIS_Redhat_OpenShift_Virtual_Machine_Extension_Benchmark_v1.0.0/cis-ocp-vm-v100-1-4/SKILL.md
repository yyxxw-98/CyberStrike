# CIS 1.4 — Disable downwardMetrics feature gate

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `downwardMetrics` feature allows users to collect and monitor additional metrics related to host and virtual machine performance.

## Rationale

Enabling the `downwardMetrics` feature introduces the risk of unauthorized or unintended sharing of information, as well as manipulation of information flow restrictions. The additional metrics include sensitive performance data, which could aid in the reconnaissance activities of a malicious actor.

## Impact

Guests are not able to use the host metrics.

## Audit Procedure

Check the `downwardMetrics` feature gate is disabled:

```bash
$ oc get hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv -ojsonpath='{.spec.featureGates.downwardMetrics}'
```

Verify the output is `false`.

## Remediation

Set `downwardMetrics` to `False`:

```bash
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type='json' -p='[
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/featureGates/downwardMetrics", "value": false },
]'
```

## Default Value

By default, the `downwardMetrics` is set to `false`.
