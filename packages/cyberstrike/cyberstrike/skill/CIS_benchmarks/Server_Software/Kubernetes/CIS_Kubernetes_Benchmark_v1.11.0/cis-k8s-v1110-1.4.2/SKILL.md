# 1.4.2 Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Do not bind the scheduler service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

## Rationale

The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface

## Impact

None

## Audit

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
```

Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Remediation

Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter

## Default Value

By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
