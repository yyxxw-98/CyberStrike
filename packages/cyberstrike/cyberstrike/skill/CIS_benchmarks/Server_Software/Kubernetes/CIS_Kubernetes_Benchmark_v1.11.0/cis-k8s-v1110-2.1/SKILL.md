# 2.1 Ensure that the --cert-file and --key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Configure TLS encryption for the etcd service.

## Rationale

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit.

## Impact

Client connections only over TLS would be served.

## Audit

Run the following command on the etcd server node

```bash
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Verify that the `--cert-file` and the `--key-file` arguments are set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption.
Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameters.

```
--cert-file=</path/to/ca-file>
--key-file=</path/to/key-file>
```

## Default Value

By default, TLS encryption is not set.
