# 1.4.1 Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Disable profiling, if not needed.

## Rationale

Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Impact

Profiling information would not be available.

## Audit

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
```

Verify that the `--profiling` argument is set to `false`.

## Remediation

Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file on the Control Plane node and set the below parameter.

```
--profiling=false
```

## Default Value

By default, profiling is enabled.
