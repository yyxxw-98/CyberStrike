# 1.1.8 Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

## Default Value

By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
