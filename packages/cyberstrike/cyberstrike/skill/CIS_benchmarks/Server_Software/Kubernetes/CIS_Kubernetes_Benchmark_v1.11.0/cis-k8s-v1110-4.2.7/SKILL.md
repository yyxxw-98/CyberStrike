# 4.2.7 Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Worker Node

## Description

Do not override node hostnames.

## Rationale

Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs.

## Impact

Some cloud providers may require this flag to ensure that hostname matches names issued by the cloud provider. In these environments, this recommendation should not apply.

## Audit

Run the following command on each node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kubelet
```

Verify that `--hostname-override` argument does not exist.
Note This setting is not configurable via the Kubelet config file.

## Remediation

Edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and remove the `--hostname-override` argument from the `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.
Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

## Default Value

By default, `--hostname-override` argument is not set.
