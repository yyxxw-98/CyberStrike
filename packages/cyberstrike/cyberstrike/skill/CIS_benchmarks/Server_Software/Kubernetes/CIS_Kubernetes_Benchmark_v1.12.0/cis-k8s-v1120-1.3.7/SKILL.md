# CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.12.0 - Control 1.3.7

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1 - Master Node

## Description

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

## Rationale

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
```

Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Remediation

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter.

## Default Value

By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0

## References

1. https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/

## Additional Information

Although the current Kubernetes documentation site says that `--address` is deprecated in favour of `--bind-address` Kubeadm 1.11 still makes use of `--address`.
