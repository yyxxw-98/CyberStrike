# 5.1.11 Minimize access to the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Users with access to the update the `approval` sub-resource of `CertificateSigningRequests` objects can approve new client certificates for the Kubernetes API effectively allowing them to create new high-privileged user accounts.

This can allow for privilege escalation to full cluster administrator, depending on users configured in the cluster.

## Rationale

The ability to update certificate signing requests should be limited.

## Audit Procedure

Review the users who have access to update the `approval` sub-resource of `CertificateSigningRequests` objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove access to the `approval` sub-resource of `CertificateSigningRequests` objects.
