# 1.2.8 Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Turn on Role Based Access Control.

## Rationale

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.

## Impact

When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access.

## Audit

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `RBAC`.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `RBAC`, for example:

```
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```

## Default Value

By default, `RBAC` authorization is not enabled.
