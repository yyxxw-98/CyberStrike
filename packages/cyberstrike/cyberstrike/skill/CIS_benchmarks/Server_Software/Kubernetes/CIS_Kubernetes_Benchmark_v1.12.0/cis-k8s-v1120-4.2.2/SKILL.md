# CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.12.0 - Control 4.2.2

## Description

Do not allow all requests. Enable explicit authorization.

## Rationale

Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests.

## Impact

Unauthorized requests will be denied.

## Audit Procedure

### Step 1: Verify via process arguments

Run the following command on each node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kubelet
```

If the `--authorization-mode` argument is present check that it is not set to `AlwaysAllow`. If it is not present check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that file sets `authorization: mode` to something other than `AlwaysAllow`.

It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the `/configz` endpoint on the Kubelet API port (typically `10250/TCP`). Accessing these with appropriate credentials will provide details of the Kubelet's configuration.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authorization: mode` to `Webhook`.

If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.

```
--authorization-mode=Webhook
```

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

## Default Value

By default, `--authorization-mode` argument is set to `AlwaysAllow`.
