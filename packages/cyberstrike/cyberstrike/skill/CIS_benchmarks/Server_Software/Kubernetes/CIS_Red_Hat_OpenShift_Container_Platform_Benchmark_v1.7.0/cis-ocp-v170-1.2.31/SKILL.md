# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 1.2.31

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Where `etcd` encryption is used, appropriate providers should be configured.

## Rationale

Where `etcd` encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the `aescbc`, `kms` and `secretbox` are likely to be appropriate options.

## Impact

When you enable `etcd` encryption, the following OpenShift API server and Kubernetes API server resources are encrypted:

- Secrets
- ConfigMaps
- Routes
- OAuth access tokens
- OAuth authorize tokens

When you enable `etcd` encryption, encryption keys are created. These keys are rotated on a weekly basis. You must have these keys in order to restore from an `etcd` backup.

## Audit Procedure

OpenShift supports encryption of data at rest of `etcd` datastore, but it is up to the customer to configure. The `aescbc` cipher had been the only supported cipher up to OCP 4.13. Starting with OCP 4.13, the `aescgm` cipher can be used as well. No other ciphers are supported. Keys are stored on the filesystem of the master and automatically rotated.

Run the following command to review the Encrypted status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:

```bash
# encrypt the etcd datastore
oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
```

The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption.

- `EncryptionCompleted`
- `All resources encrypted: routes.route.openshift.io, oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io, oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io`

If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, this means that encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

## Remediation

Follow the OpenShift documentation for encrypting etcd data.

## Default Value

By default, no encryption provider is set.
