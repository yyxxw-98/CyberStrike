# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 4.2.6

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.

## Rationale

Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.

Note: By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.

## Impact

Long-lived connections could be interrupted.

## Audit Procedure

OpenShift uses the kubernetes default of 4 hours for the streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument. Unless the cluster administrator has added the value to the node configuration, the default will be used. The value is a timeout for HTTP streaming sessions going through a kubelet, like the port-forward, exec, or attach pod operations. The `streaming-connection-idle-timeout` should not be disabled by setting it to `zero`, but it can be lowered. Note that if the value is set too low, then users using those features may experience a service interruption due to the timeout.

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This allows you to create a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

Run the following command to view the streaming connection timeout for each node:

```bash
for node in $(oc get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
  oc get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$node/proxy/configz | jq '.kubeletconfig.streamingConnectionIdleTimeout'
done
```

Verify the values returned for each node are not `0`.

## Remediation

Follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.html#create-a-kubeletconfig-crd-to-edit-kubelet-parameters_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks) to create a `kubeletconfig` CRD and set the `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to the desired value. Do not set the value to `0`.

## Default Value

By default, `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` is set to 4 hours.
