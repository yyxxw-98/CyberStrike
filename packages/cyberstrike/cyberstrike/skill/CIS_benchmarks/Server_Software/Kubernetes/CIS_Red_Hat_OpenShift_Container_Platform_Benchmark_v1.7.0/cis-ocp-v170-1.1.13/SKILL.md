# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 1.1.13

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Ensure that the `kubeconfig` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Rationale

The administrator `kubeconfig` file defines various settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

In OpenShift 4 the admin config file is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` with permissions `600`.

Run the following command:

```bash
for i in $(oc get nodes  -o name)
do
  oc debug $i --  <<EOF
       chroot /host
       stat -c%a /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
EOF
done
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

There is no remediation for updating the permissions of `kubeconfig`. The file is owned by an OpenShift operator and any changes to the file will result in a degraded cluster state.
Please do not attempt to remediate the permissions of this file.

## Default Value

By default, in OpenShift 4.14, the `kubeconfig` has permissions of `600`.

In older versions of OpenShift, the `kubeconfig` has permissions of `644`, and is not remediable. Please upgrade to OpenShift 4.14 when possible.
