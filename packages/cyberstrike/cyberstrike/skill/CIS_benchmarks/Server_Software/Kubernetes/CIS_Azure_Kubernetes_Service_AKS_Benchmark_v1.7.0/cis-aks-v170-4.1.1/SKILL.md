# 4.1.1 Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The RBAC role `cluster-admin` provides wide-ranging powers over the environment and should be used only where and when needed.

## Rationale

Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as `cluster-admin` provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as `cluster-admin` allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a `ClusterRoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a `RoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself.

## Impact

Care should be taken before removing any `clusterrolebindings` from the environment to ensure they were not required for operation of the cluster. Specifically, modifications should not be made to `clusterrolebindings` with the `system:` prefix as they are required for the operation of system components.

## Audit

Obtain a list of the principals who have access to the `cluster-admin` role by reviewing the `clusterrolebinding` output for each role binding that has access to the `cluster-admin` role.

```bash
kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,ROLE:.roleRef.name,SUBJECT:.subjects[*].name
```

Review each principal listed and ensure that `cluster-admin` privilege is required for it.

## Remediation

Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.

Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role:

```bash
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]
```

## Default Value

By default a single `clusterrolebinding` called `cluster-admin` is provided with the `system:masters` group as its principal.
