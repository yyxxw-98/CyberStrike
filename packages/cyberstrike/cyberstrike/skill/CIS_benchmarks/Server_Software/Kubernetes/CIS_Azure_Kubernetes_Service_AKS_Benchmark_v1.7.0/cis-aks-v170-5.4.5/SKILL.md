# 5.4.5 Encrypt traffic to HTTPS load balancers with TLS certificates (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

Encrypt traffic to HTTPS load balancers using TLS certificates.

## Rationale

Encrypting traffic between users and your Kubernetes workload is fundamental to protecting data sent over the web.

## Audit

Review the load balancer configurations to verify that TLS certificates are properly configured for HTTPS endpoints and that unencrypted HTTP traffic is not allowed.

## Remediation

Configure TLS certificates on all HTTPS load balancers serving traffic to the AKS cluster. Use Azure Application Gateway or an ingress controller with cert-manager to automate certificate management.
