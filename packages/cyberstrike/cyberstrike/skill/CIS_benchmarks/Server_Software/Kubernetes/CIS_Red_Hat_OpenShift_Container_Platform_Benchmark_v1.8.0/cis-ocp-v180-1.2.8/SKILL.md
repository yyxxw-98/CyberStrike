# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.8.0 - Control 1.2.8

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Do not allow all requests.

## Rationale

Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and does not filter any requests.

The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.

## Impact

Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be served.

## Audit Procedure

This controller is disabled by default in OpenShift and cannot be enabled. It has also been deprecated by the Kubernetes community as it behaves as if there were no controller.

Use the following command to verify the configured admission controllers:

```bash
oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get configmap config -o json | jq -r '.data."config.yaml"' | jq '.apiServerArguments."enable-admission-plugins"'
```

The output should not include `AlwaysAdmit`.

## Remediation

None.

## Default Value

This `AlwaysAdmit` controller is disabled by default in OpenShift and cannot be enabled.
