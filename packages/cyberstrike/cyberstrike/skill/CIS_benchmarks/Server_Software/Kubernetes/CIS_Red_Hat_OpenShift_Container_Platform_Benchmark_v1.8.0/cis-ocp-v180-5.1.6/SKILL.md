# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.8.0 - Control 5.1.6

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Service accounts tokens should not be mounted in pods except where the workload running in the pod explicitly needs to communicate with the API server.

## Rationale

Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.

## Impact

Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate with the API server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.

## Audit Procedure

Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure automatically mounting the service account token is disabled (`automountServiceAccountToken: false`), unless the resource explicitly requires this access.

Find all pods that automatically mount service account tokens:

```bash
oc get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] |
select(.spec.automountServiceAccountToken) | .metadata.name'
```

Find all service accounts that automatically mount service account tokens:

```bash
oc get serviceaccounts -A -o json | jq '.items[] |
select(.automountServiceAccountToken) | .metadata.name'
```

## Remediation

Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.

## Default Value

By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.
