# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.8.0 - Control 1.1.14

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Ensure that the `kubeconfig` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The `kubeconfig` file contains the admin credentials for the cluster. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

In OpenShift 4 the admin config file is stored in `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` with ownership `root:root`.

Run the following command.

```bash
for i in $(oc get nodes  -o name)
  do
  echo $i
  oc debug $i --  <<EOF
        chroot /host
        stat -c %U:%G  /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
EOF
  done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Default Value

By default, in OpenShift 4, `kubeconfig` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
