# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.8.0 - Control 1.2.7

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Limit the rate at which the API server accepts requests.

## Rationale

A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.

## Impact

None, as the OpenShift kubelet has been fixed to send fewer requests.

## Audit Procedure

OpenShift 4.5 and forward uses the api priority and fairness feature to limit the rate at which the API server accepts requests.

Run the following command:

```bash
#Verify the APIPriorityAndFairness feature-gate
oc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq '.spec.observedConfig.apiServerArguments'
```

For 4.5, verify that the feature-gate is turned on for the APIServer priority and fairness: `APIPriorityAndFairness=true`. In OCP 4.5 and earlier, the default set of admission plugins are compiled into the `apiserver` and are not visible in the configuration yaml.

## Remediation

No remediation is required.

## Default Value

By default, the OpenShift kubelet has been fixed to send fewer requests. Version 4.6+ it is enabled by default.
