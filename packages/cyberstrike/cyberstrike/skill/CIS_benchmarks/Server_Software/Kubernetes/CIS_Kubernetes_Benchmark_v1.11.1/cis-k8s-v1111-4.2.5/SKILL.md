# 4.2.5 Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Worker Node

## Description

Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.

## Rationale

Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.

**Note:** By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.

## Impact

Long-lived connections could be interrupted.

## Audit

Run the following command on each node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kubelet
```

Verify that the `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` argument is not set to `0`.
If the argument is not present, and there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, check that it does not set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to 0.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to a value other than 0.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```
--streaming-connection-idle-timeout=5m
```

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

## Default Value

By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours.
