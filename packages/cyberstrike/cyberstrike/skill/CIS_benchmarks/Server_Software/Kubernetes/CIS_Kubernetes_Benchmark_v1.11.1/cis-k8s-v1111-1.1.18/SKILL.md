# CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.11.1 - Control 1.1.18

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1 - Master Node

## Description

Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller Manager. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
```

## Default Value

By default, `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
