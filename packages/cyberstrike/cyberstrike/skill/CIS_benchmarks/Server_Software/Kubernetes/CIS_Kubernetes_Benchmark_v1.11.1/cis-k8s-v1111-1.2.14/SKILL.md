# 1.2.14 Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2 - Master Node

## Description

Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.

## Rationale

Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and `Pod` objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in on kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.

```bash
--enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...
```

## Default Value

By default, `NodeRestriction` is not set.
