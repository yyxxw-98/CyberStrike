# 5.1.9 Minimize access to create persistent volumes (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

The ability to create persistent volumes in a cluster can provide an opportunity for privilege escalation, via the creation of `hostPath` volumes. As persistent volumes are not covered by Pod Security Admission, a user with access to create persistent volumes may be able to get access to sensitive files from the underlying host even where restrictive Pod Security Admission policies are in place.

## Rationale

The ability to create persistent volumes in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Review the users who have create access to `PersistentVolume` objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove `create` access to `PersistentVolume` objects in the cluster.

## Default Value

None
