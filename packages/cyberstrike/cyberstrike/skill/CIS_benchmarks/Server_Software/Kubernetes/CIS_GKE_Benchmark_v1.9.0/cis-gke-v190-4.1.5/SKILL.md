# 4.1.5 Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Service accounts tokens should not be mounted in pods except where the workload running in the pod explicitly needs to communicate with the API server.

## Rationale

Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.

## Impact

Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate with the API server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.

## Audit

Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure that the option below is set, unless the resource explicitly requires this access.

```yaml
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

## Remediation

Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.

## Default Value

By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.
