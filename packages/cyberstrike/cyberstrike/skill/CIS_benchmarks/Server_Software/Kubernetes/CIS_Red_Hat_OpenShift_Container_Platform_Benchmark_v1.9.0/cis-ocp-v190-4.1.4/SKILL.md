# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.9.0 - Control 4.1.4

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

If `kube-proxy` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.

## Rationale

The kubeconfig file for `kube-proxy` controls various parameters for the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

In OpenShift 4, the `kube-proxy` runs within the `sdn` pods, which copies the `kubeconfig` from a configmap to the container at `/tmp/kubeconfig`, with root:root ownership.

Run the following command:

```bash
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname)
do
    oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- \
      stat -Lc %U:%G /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml
done
```

Verify that the `kube-proxy-config.yaml` file has ownership root:root.

## Remediation

None required. The configuration is managed by OpenShift operators.

## Default Value

By default, `proxy` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
