# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.9.0 - Control 3.2.2

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 2

## Description

Ensure that the audit policy created for the cluster covers key security concerns.

## Rationale

Security audit logs should cover access and modification of key resources in the cluster, to enable them to form an effective part of a security environment.

## Impact

Increasing audit logging will consume resources on the nodes or other log destinations.

## Audit Procedure

Review the audit policy provided for the cluster and ensure that it covers the following areas:

- The use of sensitive resources like `Secrets`, `ConfigMaps`, and `TokenReviews` are logged at the `Metadata` level
- Modifications to `pods` and `deployments` are logged at the `Request` level
- The use of `pods/exec`, `pods/portforward`, `pods/proxy`, and `services/proxy` are at least logged at the `Metadata` level

For most requests, minimally logging at the `Metadata` level is recommended (the most basic level of logging).

You can configure the audit feature to set log level, retention policy, and the type of events to log. You can set the log level settings for an overall component or the API server to one of the following. The setting can be different for each setting.

Use the following command to view the audit policies for the Kubernetes API server:

```bash
oc get configmap -n openshift-kube-apiserver kube-apiserver-audit-policies -o json | jq -r '.data."policy.yaml"'
```

Use the following command to view the audit policies for the OpenShift API server:

```bash
oc get configmap -n openshift-apiserver audit -o json | jq -r '.data."policy.yaml"'
```

## Remediation

Update the audit log policy profile to use `WriteRequestBodies`.

## Default Value

Audit logging is configured by default using the `Default` audit policy, but you are advised to review the log retention settings and log levels to align with your cluster's security posture.
