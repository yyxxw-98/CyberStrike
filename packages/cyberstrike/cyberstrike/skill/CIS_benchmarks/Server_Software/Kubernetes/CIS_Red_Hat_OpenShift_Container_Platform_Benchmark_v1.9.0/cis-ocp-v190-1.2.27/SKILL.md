# CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Benchmark v1.9.0 - Control 1.2.27

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1

## Description

Setup TLS connection on the API server.

## Rationale

API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If `--client-ca-file` argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the `client-ca-file` is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate.

## Impact

TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment. By default, OpenShift uses X.509 certificates to provide secure connections between the API server and node/kubelet. OpenShift Container Platform monitors certificates for proper validity, for the cluster certificates it issues and manages. The OpenShift Container Platform alerting framework has rules to help identify when a certificate issue is about to occur. These rules consist of the following checks:

- API server client certificate expiration is less than five minutes.

## Audit Procedure

OpenShift uses X.509 certificates to provide secure connections between API server and node/kubelet by default. OpenShift configures the `client-ca-file` value and does not use value assigned to the `client-ca-file` flag. OpenShift generates the necessary files and sets the arguments appropriately.

The API server is accessible by clients external to the cluster at `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`. The administrator must set a custom default certificate to be used by the API server when serving content in order to enable clients to access the API server at a different host name or without the need to distribute the cluster-managed certificate authority (CA) certificates to the clients.

Run the following command:

```bash
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | \
  jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
  jq -r .servingInfo.clientCA
```

For version 4.10+:

```bash
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -o json | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq -r '.apiServerArguments."client-ca-file"'
```

Verify that the following file exists.

`/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-certs/configmaps/client-ca/ca-bundle.crt`

## Remediation

None.

## Default Value

By default, OpenShift configures the `client-ca-file` and automatically manages the certificate. It does not use the value assigned to the `client-ca-file` flag.

You may optionally set a custom default certificate to be used by the API server when serving content in order to enable clients to access the API server at a different host name or without the need to distribute the cluster-managed certificate authority (CA) certificates to the clients.

Please follow the OpenShift documentation for providing certificates for OpenShift to use.
