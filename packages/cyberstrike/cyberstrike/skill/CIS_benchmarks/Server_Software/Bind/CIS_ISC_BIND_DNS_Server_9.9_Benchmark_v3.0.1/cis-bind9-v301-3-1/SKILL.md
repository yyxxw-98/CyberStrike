# CIS 3.1 — Ignore Erroneous or Unwanted Queries

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Authoritative Name Server
- Level 1 - Caching Only Name Server

## Description

BIND can be configured to ignore requests originating from specified network segments. This is accomplished by implementing the `blackhole` option in `named.conf`. It is recommended that this feature be implemented to ignore requests that originate outside of expected network segments.

## Rationale

By ignoring traffic that originates from unexpected networks, the server's exposure to malicious entities is reduced.

## Impact

Not Applicable

## Audit Procedure

Attempt to query the server from an address that has been placed in the `blackhole` list. If properly configured, the query will fail.

```bash
nslookup www.google.com ns1.example.com
```

## Remediation

Add a `blackhole` option for multicast and link local addresses, and all private RFC 1918 addresses that are not being used.

```
blackhole {
    // Private RFC 1918 addresses
    10/8; 192.168/16; 172.16/12;
    // Multicast
    224/8;
    // Link Local
    169.254/16;
};
```

## Default Value

No networks are blackhole'd by default.
