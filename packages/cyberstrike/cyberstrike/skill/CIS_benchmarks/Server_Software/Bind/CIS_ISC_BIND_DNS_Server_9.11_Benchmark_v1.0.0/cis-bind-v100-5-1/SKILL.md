# CIS 5.1 — Securely Authenticate Zone Transfers

## Profile Applicability

- Authoritative Name Server Level 2

## Description

A zone transfer is a mechanism commonly used by DNS deployments to replicate zone information from master/primary servers to slave/secondary servers. Each pair of name servers participating in zone transfers should authenticate the requests and ensure the integrity of the responses by using a unique shared secret TSIG key. BIND can be configured to respond only to authenticated transfer requests by using the `allow-transfer` statement with a key statement, that restricts the transfers to servers that provide a MAC using the named key.

## Rationale

A zone transfer is a popular information disclosure attack as it provides the entire list of resource records for a zone. There should be very few systems such as the slave name servers that should be authorized to perform a zone transfer for your domains. Authentication of transfer requests should not be made using only an IP address, since IP addresses can be spoofed, but rather by using TSIG keys.

## Impact

Not specified in the PDF.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following:

- Search all of the included configuration files and zone files for the `allow-transfer` option.

```
grep -C 1 allow-transfer $CONFIG_FILES $ZONE_FILES
```

- If there are no `allow-transfer` statements found, then the configuration allows zone transfers, and is not compliant.
- If the only value in the address match list of all the `allow-transfer` statements is the value `none`, either with or without quotes, then the configuration is compliant. Examples output is shown below.

```
allow-transfer { none; };
allow-transfer {"none";};
```

- If **all** of the address list values of the `allow-transfer` statements have the keyword `key` followed by a name, then the configuration is compliant.

```
allow-transfer { key ns1-ns2.cisecurity.org.; };
```

- If the predefined address value of `any` appears in the `allow-transfer` statement, then the configuration is not compliant. If any of the address list values contains ACL names, IP addresses or network ranges, then the configuration is also not compliant.

```
allow-transfer { any; }
allow-transfer { 10.10.42.56; key ns1-ns2.cisecurity.org.; }
```

- Additionally, it is possible to confirm if a transfer is allowed to an IP address without a key, by performing the following command on the system with the suspected allowed IP address. An error of `Transfer failed` is the expected result. If a list of resource records is returned, then the transfer was allowed without a key, and the configuration is non-compliant.

```
$ dig @ns1.cisecurity.org cisecurity.org axfr
; <<>> DiG 9.9 . . .
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
; Transfer failed.
```

## Remediation

Generate TSIG keys 256 bits in length, unique for each host-to-host communication. Securely Transfer the keys and configure the keys to be required in all `allow-transfer` statements.

## Default Value

If the `allow-transfer` statement is missing, then transfers are allowed to any host.
