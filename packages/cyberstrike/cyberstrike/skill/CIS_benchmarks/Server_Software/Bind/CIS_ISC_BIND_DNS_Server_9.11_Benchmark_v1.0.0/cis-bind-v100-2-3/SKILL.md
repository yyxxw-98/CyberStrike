# CIS 2.3 — Lock the BIND User Account

## Profile Applicability

- Authoritative Name Server Level 1
- Caching Only Name Server Level 1

## Description

The user account under which BIND runs should not have a valid password, but should be locked.

## Rationale

As a defense-in-depth measure the named user account should be locked to prevent logins, and to prevent a user from `su`'ing to `named` using a password. In general, there shouldn't be a need for anyone to have to `su` as `named`, and when there is a need, then `sudo` should be used instead, which would not require the account password.

## Impact

Not specified.

## Audit Procedure

Ensure the named account is locked using the following:

```bash
# passwd -S named
named LK 2020-02-11 -1 -1 -1 -1 (Password locked.)
```

The results must have the LK value in the second field, similar to the output shown above.

## Remediation

To remediate, lock the named account using the password command with the lock option as shown below.

```bash
# passwd -l named
Locking password for user named.
passwd: Success
```

## Default Value

Account is locked by default.

## References

None listed.
