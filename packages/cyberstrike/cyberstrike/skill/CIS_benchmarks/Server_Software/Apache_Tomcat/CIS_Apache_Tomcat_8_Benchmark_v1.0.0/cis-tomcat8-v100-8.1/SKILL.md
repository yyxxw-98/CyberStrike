# 8.1 Restrict runtime access to sensitive packages (Automated)

## Description

`package.access` grants or revokes access to listed packages during runtime. It is recommended that application access to certain packages be restricted.

## Rationale

Prevent web applications from accessing restricted or unknown packages which may be malicious or dangerous to the application.

## Audit Procedure

Review `package.access` list in `$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.properties` to ensure only allowed packages are defined.

## Remediation

Edit `$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.properties` by adding allowed packages to the `package.access` list:

```
package.access =
sun.,org.apache.catalina.,org.apache.coyote.,org.apache.jasper.,org.apache.to
mcat.
```

## Default Value

The default package.access value within `$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.properties` is:

```
package.access =
sun.,org.apache.catalina.,org.apache.coyote.,org.apache.tomcat.,
org.apache.jasper.
```
