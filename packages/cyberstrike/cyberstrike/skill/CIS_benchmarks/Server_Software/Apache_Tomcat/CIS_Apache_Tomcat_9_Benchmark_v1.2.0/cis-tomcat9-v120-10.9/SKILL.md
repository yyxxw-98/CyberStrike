# 10.9 Configure connectionTimeout (Automated)

## Description

The `connectionTimeout` setting allows Tomcat to close idle sockets after a specific amount of time to save system resources.

## Rationale

Closing idle sockets reduces system resource usage which can provide better performance and help protect against denial of Service attacks.

## Impact

This timeout will also apply when reading any request body when `disableUploadTimeout` is not set to `false`.

## Audit Procedure

Locate each `connectionTimeout` setting in `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml` and verify the setting is correct.

```
# grep connectionTimeout $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml
```

## Remediation

Set the `connectionTimeout` for each connector in `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml` ensure to the optimal number of milliseconds based on hardware resources, load, and number of concurrent connections.

```
connectionTimeout="60000"
```

## Default Value

By default this is set to `60000` (i.e. 60 seconds).
