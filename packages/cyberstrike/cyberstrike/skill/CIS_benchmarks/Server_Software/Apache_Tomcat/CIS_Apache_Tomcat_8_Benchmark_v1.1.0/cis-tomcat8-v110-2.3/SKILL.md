# Alter the Advertised server.built Date (Scored)

## Description

The `server.built` date represents the date which Tomcat was compiled and packaged. This value is presented to Tomcat clients when clients connect to the server.

## Rationale

Altering the `server.built` string may increase the complexity for attackers to determine which vulnerabilities affect the server platform.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following to determine if the server.built value has been changed. Extract the `ServerInfo.properties` file and examine the `server.built` attribute.

```bash
$ cd $CATALINA_HOME/lib
$ jar xf catalina.jar org/apache/catalina/util/ServerInfo.properties
$ grep server.built org/apache/catalina/util/ServerInfo.properties
```

## Remediation

Perform the following to alter the server version string which gets displayed when clients connect to the server.

1. Extract the `ServerInfo.properties` file from the `catalina.jar` file:

```bash
$ cd $CATALINA_HOME/lib
$ jar xf catalina.jar org/apache/catalina/util/ServerInfo.properties
```

2. Navigate to the `util` directory that was created

```bash
$ cd org/apache/Catalina/util
```

3. Open `ServerInfo.properties` in an editor
4. Update the `server.built` attribute in the `ServerInfo.properties` file.

```
server.built=
```

5. Update the `catalina.jar` with the modified `ServerInfo.properties` file.

```bash
$ jar uf catalina.jar org/apache/catalina/util/ServerInfo.properties
```

## Default Value

The default value for the `server.built` attribute is build date and time. For example, `Jul 8 2008 11:40:35`.
