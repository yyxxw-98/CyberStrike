# Remove extraneous files and directories (Scored)

## Description

The installation may provide example applications, documentation, and other directories which may not serve a production use.

## Rationale

Removing sample resources is a defense in depth measure which reduces potential exposures introduced by these resources.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following to determine the existence of extraneous resources:

```bash
$ ls -l $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/examples \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/docs \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/host-manager \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager
```

No output implies no sample resources are present.

## Remediation

Perform the following to remove extraneous resources:

```bash
$ rm -rf $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/docs \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/examples \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT
```

If the Manager and HOST-Manager application are not utilized, also remove the following resources:

```bash
$ rm -rf $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/host-manager \
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager
```

## Default Value

`docs`, `examples`, `ROOT`, `manager` and `host-manager` are default web applications shipped with Tomcat.
