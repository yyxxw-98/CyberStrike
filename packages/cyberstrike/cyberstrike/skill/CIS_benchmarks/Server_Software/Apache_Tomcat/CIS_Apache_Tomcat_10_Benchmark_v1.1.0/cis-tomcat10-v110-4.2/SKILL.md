# Restrict access to $CATALINA_BASE (Automated)

## Description

`$CATALINA_BASE` is the environment variable that specifies the base directory which most relative paths are resolved. `$CATALINA_BASE` is usually used when there are multiple instances of Tomcat running. It is important to protect access to this in order to protect the Tomcat-related binaries and libraries from unauthorized modification. It is recommended that the ownership of `$CATALINA_BASE` be tomcat_admin:tomcat. It is also recommended that the permission on `$CATALINA_BASE` block read, write, and execute for the world (o-rwx) and block write access to the group (g-w).

## Rationale

The security of processes and data which traverse or depend on Tomcat may become compromised if the `$CATALINA_BASE` is not secured.

## Audit Procedure

Perform the following to ensure the permission on the `$CATALINA_BASE` directory prevent unauthorized modification.

```bash
$ cd $CATALINA_BASE
$ find . -follow -maxdepth 0 \( -perm /o+rwx,g=w -o ! -user tomcat_admin -o ! -group tomcat \) -ls
```

The above command should not produce any output.

## Remediation

Perform the following to establish the recommended state:

1. Set the ownership of the `$CATALINA_BASE` to tomcat_admin:tomcat.

```bash
# chown tomcat_admin.tomcat $CATALINA_BASE
```

2. Remove write permissions for the group and read, write, and execute permissions for the world

```bash
# chmod g-w,o-rwx $CATALINA_BASE
```
