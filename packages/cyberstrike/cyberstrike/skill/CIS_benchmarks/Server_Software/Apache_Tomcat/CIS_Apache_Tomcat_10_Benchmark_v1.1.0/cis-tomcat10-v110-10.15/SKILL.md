# 10.15 Do not resolve hosts on logging valves (Automated)

## Description

Setting `enableLookups` to `true` on Connector will result in a DNS look-ups to obtain the host name of the remote client before logging any information. This uses additional resources when logging.

## Rationale

Allowing `enableLookups` adds additional overhead to resolve the host name of a remote client which is rarely needed.

## Audit Procedure

Ensure Connector elements have the `enableLookups` attribute does not exist or is set to `false`.

```
# grep enableLookups $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml
```

## Remediation

In Connector elements, set the `enableLookups` attribute to `false` or remove it.

```xml
<Connector ... enableLookups="false" />
```

## Default Value

By default, DNS lookups are disabled.
