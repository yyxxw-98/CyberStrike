# Ensure that TLS CA certificate file ownership is set to root:root (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker - Linux

## Description

You should verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed along with the `--tlscacert` parameter) is individually owned and group owned by `root`.

## Rationale

The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on a given CA certificate. It must be therefore be individually owned and group owned by `root` to ensure that it cannot be modified by less privileged users.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to verify that the TLS CA certificate file is owned and group owned by `root`:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G <path to TLS CA certificate file> | grep -v root:root
```

The above command should return no results.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command:

```bash
chown root:root <path to TLS CA certificate file>
```

This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the TLS CA certificate file to `root`.

## Default Value

By default, the ownership and group-ownership for TLS CA certificate file is correctly set to `root`.
