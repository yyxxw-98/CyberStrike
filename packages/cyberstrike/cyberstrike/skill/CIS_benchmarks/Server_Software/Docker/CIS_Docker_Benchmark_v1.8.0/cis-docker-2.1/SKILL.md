# Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user, if possible (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

• Level 1 - Docker - Linux

## Description

Rootless mode executes the Docker daemon and containers inside a user namespace, with both the daemon and the container are running without root privileges.

## Rationale

Rootless mode allows running the Docker daemon and containers as a non-root user to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the daemon and the container runtime.

## Impact

There are multiple prerequisites depending on which distribution that is in use, and also known limitations regarding networking and resource limitation.

Running in rootless mode also changes the location of any configuration files in use, including all containers using the daemon.

## Audit Procedure

Running the following command will show any running `dockerd` processes and which user that is managing the daemon.

```bash
ps -fe | grep 'dockerd'
```

## Remediation

Follow the current Docker documentation on how to install the Docker daemon as a non-root user.

## Default Value

The Docker daemon is running as the `root` user by default.
