# Ensure that the Docker socket file permissions are set to 660 or more restrictively (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker - Linux

## Description

You should verify that the Docker socket file has permissions of `660` or are configured more restrictively.

## Rationale

Only `root` and the members of the `docker` group should be allowed to read and write to the default Docker Unix socket. The Docker socket file should therefore have permissions of `660` or more restrictive permissions.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to verify that the Docker socket file has permissions of `660` or more restrictive permissions

```bash
stat -c %a /var/run/docker.sock
```

## Remediation

You should execute the command below.

```bash
chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

This sets the file permissions of the Docker socket file to `660`.

## Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Docker socket file is correctly set to `660`.
