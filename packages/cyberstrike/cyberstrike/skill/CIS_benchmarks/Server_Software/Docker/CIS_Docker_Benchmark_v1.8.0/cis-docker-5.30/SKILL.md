# 5.30 Ensure that Docker's default bridge "docker0" is not used (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2 - Docker - Linux

## Description

You should not use Docker's default bridge `docker0`. Instead you should use Docker's user-defined networks for container networking.

## Rationale

Docker connects virtual interfaces created in bridge mode to a common bridge called `docker0`. This default networking model is vulnerable to ARP spoofing and MAC flooding attacks as there is no filtering applied to it.

## Impact

User-defined networks need to be configured and managed in line with organizational security policy.

## Audit Procedure

You should run the command below, and verify that containers are on a user-defined network and not the default `docker0` bridge.

```
docker network ls --quiet | xargs docker network inspect --format '{{ .Name }}: {{ .Options }}'
```

## Remediation

You should follow the Docker documentation and set up a user-defined network. All the containers should be run in this network.

## Default Value

By default, Docker runs containers within the default `docker0` bridge.
