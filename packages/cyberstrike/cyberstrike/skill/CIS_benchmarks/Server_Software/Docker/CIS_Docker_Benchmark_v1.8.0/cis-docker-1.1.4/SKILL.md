# Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /run/containerd (Manual)

## Description

Audit `/run/containerd`.

## Rationale

As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with `root` privileges and its behaviour depends on some key files and directories. `/run/containerd` is one such directory. As it holds all the information about containers it should be audited.

## Impact

Auditing can generate large log files. You should ensure that these are rotated and archived periodically. A separate partition should also be created for audit logs to avoid filling up any other critical partition.

## Audit

You should verify that there is an audit rule applied to the `/run/containerd` directory. For example, you could execute the command below:

```bash
auditctl -l | grep /run/containerd
```

This should list a rule for the `/run/containerd` directory.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/run/containerd` directory.

For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-a exit,always -F path=/run/containerd -F perm=war -k docker
```

Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

## Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited.
