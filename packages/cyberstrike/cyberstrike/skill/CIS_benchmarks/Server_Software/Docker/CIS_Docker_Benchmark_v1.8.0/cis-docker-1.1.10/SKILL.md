# Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /etc/default/docker (Automated)

## Description

Audit `/etc/default/docker`, if applicable.

## Rationale

As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with `root` privileges and its behavior depends on some key files and directories. `/etc/default/docker` is one such file. It holds various parameters related to the Docker daemon and should therefore be audited.

## Impact

Auditing can generate large log files. You should ensure that these are rotated and archived periodically. A separate partition should also be created for audit logs to avoid filling up any other critical partition.

## Audit

You should verify that there is an audit rule associated with the `/etc/default/docker` file.

For example, you could execute the command below:

```bash
auditctl -l | grep /etc/default/docker
```

This should display a rule for the `/etc/default/docker` file.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/etc/default/docker` file.

For example:
Add the line below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/default/docker -k docker
```

Then restart the audit daemon.
For example:

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

## Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited so these defaults should be changed in line with organizational security policy. The file `/etc/default/docker` may not be present, and if so, this recommendation is not applicable.
