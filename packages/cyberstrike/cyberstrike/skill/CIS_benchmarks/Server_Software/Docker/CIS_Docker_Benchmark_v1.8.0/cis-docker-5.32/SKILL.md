# 5.32 Ensure that the Docker socket is not mounted inside any containers (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker - Linux

## Description

The Docker socket `docker.sock` should not be mounted inside a container.

## Rationale

If the Docker socket is mounted inside a container it could allow processes running within the container to execute Docker commands which would effectively allow for full control of the host.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

You should run the following command:

```
docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Volumes={{ .Mounts }}' | grep docker.sock
```

This would return any instances where `docker.sock` had been mapped to a container as a volume.

## Remediation

You should ensure that no containers mount `docker.sock` as a volume.

## Default Value

By default, `docker.sock` is not mounted inside containers.
