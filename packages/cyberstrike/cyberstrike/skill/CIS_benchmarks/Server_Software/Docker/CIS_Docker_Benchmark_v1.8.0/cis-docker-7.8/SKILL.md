# 7.8 Ensure that CA certificates are rotated as appropriate (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker Swarm

## Description

You should rotate root CA certificates as appropriate.

## Rationale

Docker Swarm uses TLS for clustering operations between its nodes. Certificate rotation ensures that in an event such as a compromised node or key, it is difficult to impersonate a node. Node certificates depend upon root CA certificates. For operational security, it is important to rotate these frequently. Currently, root CA certificates are not rotated automatically and you should therefore establish a process for rotating them in line with your organizational security policy.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

You should check the time stamp on the root CA certificate file. For example:

```
ls -l /var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-root-ca.crt
```

The certificate should show a time stamp in line with the organizational rotation policy.

## Remediation

You should run the command below to rotate a certificate.

```
docker swarm ca --rotate
```

## Default Value

By default, root CA certificates are not rotated.
