# 7.3 Ensure that all Docker swarm overlay networks are encrypted (Manual)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker Swarm

## Description

Ensure that all Docker swarm overlay networks are encrypted.

## Rationale

By default, data exchanged between containers on nodes on the overlay network is not encrypted. This could potentially expose traffic between containers.

## Impact

None

## Audit Procedure

You should run the command below to ensure that each overlay network has been encrypted.

```
docker network ls --filter driver=overlay --quiet | xargs docker network inspect --format '{{.Name}} {{ .Options }}'
```

## Remediation

You should create overlay networks the with `--opt encrypted` flag.

## Default Value

By default, data exchanged in overlay networks in Docker swarm mode is not encrypted.
