# Ensure that the docker.service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker - Linux

## Description

You should verify that the `docker.service` file ownership and group ownership are correctly set to `root`.

## Rationale

The `docker.service` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be individually and group owned by the `root` user in order to ensure that it is not modified or corrupted by a less privileged user.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service
```

**Step 2:** If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file exists, execute the command below including the correct file path in order to verify that the file is owned and group owned by `root`.

For example:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service | grep -v root:root
```

The command above should not return anything.

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service
```

**Step 2:** If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file does exist, you should execute the command below, including the correct file path, in order to set the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`.

For example:

```bash
chown root:root /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
```

## Default Value

This file may not be present on the system and if it is not, this recommendation is not applicable. By default, if the file is present, the correct permissions are for the ownership and group ownership to be set to "root".
