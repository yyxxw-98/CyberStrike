# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.6.0 - 1.1.6

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Docker - Linux
- Level 2 - Docker - Linux

## Description

Audit `/etc/docker`.

## Rationale

As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with `root` privilege and its behavior depends on some key files and directories, one of these being `/etc/docker`. This holds various certificates and keys used for TLS communication between Docker daemon and Docker client and as such it should be audited.

## Impact

Auditing can generate large log files. You should ensure that these are rotated and archived periodically. A separate partition should also be created for audit logs to avoid filling up any other critical partition.

## Audit Procedure

You should verify that there is an audit rule applied to the `/etc/docker` directory. For example, you could execute the command below:

```bash
auditctl -l | grep /etc/docker
```

This should display a rule for the `/etc/docker` directory.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/etc/docker` directory.

For example:
Add the line below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/docker -k docker
```

Then restart the audit daemon. For example:

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

## Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited.
