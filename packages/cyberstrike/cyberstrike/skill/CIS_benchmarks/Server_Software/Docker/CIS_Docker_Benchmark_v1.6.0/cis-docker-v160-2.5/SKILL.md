# Ensure insecure registries are not used

**Profile Applicability:** Level 1 - Docker - Linux

**Assessment Status:** Manual

## Description

Docker considers a private registry either secure or insecure. By default, registries are considered secure.

## Rationale

A secure registry uses TLS. A copy of registry's CA certificate is placed on the Docker host at `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>/` directory. An insecure registry is one which does not have a valid registry certificate, or one not using TLS. Insecure registries should not be used as they present a risk of traffic interception and modification.

Additionally, once a registry has been marked as insecure commands such as `docker pull`, `docker push`, and `docker search` will not result in an error message and users may indefinitely be working with this type of insecure registry without ever being notified of the risk of potential compromise.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to find out if any insecure registries are in use:

```bash
docker info --format 'Insecure Registries:
{{.RegistryConfig.InsecureRegistryCIDRs}}'
```

## Remediation

You should ensure that no insecure registries are in use.

## Default Value

By default, Docker assumes all, but local, registries are secure.
