# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 3.12

## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed along with the `--tlscert` parameter) has permissions of `444` or more restrictive permissions.

## Rationale

The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on the given server certificate. It should therefore have permissions of `444` to prevent its modification.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to verify that the Docker server certificate file has permissions of `444` or more restrictive permissions:

```bash
stat -c %a <path to Docker server certificate file>
```

## Remediation

You should execute the command below:

```bash
chmod 444 <path to Docker server certificate file>
```

This sets the file permissions of the Docker server certificate file to `444`.

## Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Docker server certificate file might not be `444`. The default file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific `umask` values.
