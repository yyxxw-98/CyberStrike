# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 5.23

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 2
- **Type:** Manual
- **Platform:** Docker - Linux

## Description

You should not use `docker exec` with the `--privileged` option.

## Rationale

Using the `--privileged` option in `docker exec` commands gives extended Linux capabilities to the command. This could potentially be an insecure practice, particularly when you are running containers with reduced capabilities or with enhanced restrictions.

## Impact

If you need enhanced capabilities within a container, then run it with all the permissions it requires. These should be specified individually.

## Audit Procedure

If you have auditing enabled as recommended in Section 1, you can use the command below to filter out `docker exec` commands that use the `--privileged` option.

```bash
ausearch -k docker | grep exec | grep privileged
```

## Remediation

You should not use the `--privileged` option in `docker exec` commands.

## Default Value

By default, the `docker exec` command runs without the `--privileged` option.
