# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 3.5

## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/docker` directory ownership and group ownership is correctly set to `root`.

## Rationale

The `/etc/docker` directory contains certificates and keys in addition to various other sensitive files. It should therefore be individual owned and group owned by `root` in order to ensure that it can not be modified by less privileged users.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to verify that the directory is owned and group owned by `root`:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/docker | grep -v root:root
```

This command should not return any data.

## Remediation

To resolve this issue you should run the following command:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/docker
```

This sets the ownership and group ownership for the directory to `root`.

## Default Value

By default, the ownership and group ownership for this directory is correctly set to `root`.
