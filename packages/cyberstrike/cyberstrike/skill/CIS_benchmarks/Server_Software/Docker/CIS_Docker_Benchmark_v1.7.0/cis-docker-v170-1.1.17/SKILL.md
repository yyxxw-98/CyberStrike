# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 1.1.17

## Profile

- **Level:** 2 - Docker - Linux
- **Assessment Status:** Automated

## Description

Audit `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` if applicable.

## Rationale

As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with `root` privileges and its behavior depends on some key files and directories. `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` is one such file and as such should be audited.

## Impact

Auditing can generate large log files. You should ensure that these are rotated and archived periodically. A separate partition should also be created for audit logs to avoid filling up any other critical partition.

## Audit Procedure

You should verify that there is an audit rule corresponding to `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` file.
For example, you could execute the command below:

```bash
auditctl -l | grep /usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
```

This should display a rule for `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` file.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` file.
For example:
Add the line below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2 -k docker
```

Then restart the audit daemon.
For example:

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

## Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2` may not be present on the system and in that case, this recommendation is not applicable.
