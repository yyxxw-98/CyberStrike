# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 5.27

## Profile Applicability

- **Level:** 1
- **Type:** Manual
- **Platform:** Docker - Linux

## Description

If the container image does not have an `HEALTHCHECK` instruction defined, you should use the `--health-cmd` parameter at container runtime to check container health.

## Rationale

If the container image you are using does not have a pre-defined `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, use the `--health-cmd` parameter to check container health at runtime.

Based on the reported health status, remedial actions can be taken if necessary.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should run the command below and ensure that all containers are reporting their health status:

```bash
docker ps --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Health={{ .State.Health.Status }}'
```

## Remediation

You should run the container using the `--health-cmd` parameter.

For example:

```bash
docker run -d --health-cmd='stat /etc/passwd || exit 1' nginx
```

## Default Value

By default, health checks are not carried out at container runtime.
