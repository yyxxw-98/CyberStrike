# CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 - Control 3.10

## Description

You should verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed along with the `--tlscacert` parameter) has permissions of `444` or is set more restrictively.

## Rationale

The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on a given CA certificate. It must therefore have permissions of `444`, or more restrictive permissions to ensure that the file cannot be modified by a less privileged user.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

You should execute the command below to verify that the TLS CA certificate file has permissions of `444` or that these permissions are more restrictively set:

```bash
stat -c %a <path to TLS CA certificate file>
```

## Remediation

You should execute the following command:

```bash
chmod 444 <path to TLS CA certificate file>
```

This sets the file permissions on the TLS CA file to `444`.

## Default Value

By default, the permissions for the TLS CA certificate file might not be `444`. The default file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific `umask` values.
