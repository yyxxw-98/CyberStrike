# AC-2(4) Automated Audit Actions

> **Enhancement of:** AC-2

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Account management audit records are defined in accordance with [AU-02](#au-2) and reviewed, analyzed, and reported in accordance with [AU-06](#au-6).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-2(4) Automated Audit Actions is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-2(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-2(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions.

### Implementation Guidance

Account management audit records are defined in accordance with [AU-02](#au-2) and reviewed, analyzed, and reported in accordance with [AU-06](#au-6).
