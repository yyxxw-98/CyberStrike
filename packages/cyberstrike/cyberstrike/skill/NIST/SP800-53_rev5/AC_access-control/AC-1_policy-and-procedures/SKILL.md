# AC-1 Policy and Procedures

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-1 Policy and Procedures is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 4 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-1

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-1 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Develop, document, and disseminate to [organization-defined]:
[organization-defined] access control policy that:
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated access controls;
Designate an [organization-defined] to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and
Review and update the current access control:
Policy [organization-defined] and following [organization-defined] ; and
Procedures [organization-defined] and following [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                    | Severity | Impact                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| AC-1 Policy and Procedures not implemented | High     | Access Control            |
| AC-1 partially implemented                 | Medium   | Incomplete Access Control |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
