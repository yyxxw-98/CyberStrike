# AC-19(5) Full Device or Container-based Encryption

> **Enhancement of:** AC-19

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to data and information encryption on mobile devices, including encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-19(5) Full Device or Container-based Encryption is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-19(5)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-19

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-19(5) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Employ [organization-defined] to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to data and information encryption on mobile devices, including encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                            | Severity | Impact                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| AC-19(5) Full Device or Container-based Encryption not implemented | High     | Access Control            |
| AC-19(5) partially implemented                                     | Medium   | Incomplete Access Control |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
