# AC-19(4) Restrictions for Classified Information

> **Enhancement of:** AC-19

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

None.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-19(4) Restrictions for Classified Information is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 5 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-19(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-19

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-19(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Prohibit the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted by the authorizing official; and
Enforce the following restrictions on individuals permitted by the authorizing official to use unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information:
Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified systems is prohibited;
Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified systems requires approval from the authorizing official;
Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the unclassified mobile devices is prohibited; and
Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject to random reviews and inspections by [organization-defined] , and if classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed.
Restrict the connection of classified mobile devices to classified systems in accordance with [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

None.
