# AC-4(24) Internal Normalized Format

> **Enhancement of:** AC-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Converting data into normalized forms is one of most of effective mechanisms to stop malicious attacks and large classes of data exfiltration.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-4(24) Internal Normalized Format is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-4(24)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-4(24) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

When transferring information between different security domains, parse incoming data into an internal normalized format and regenerate the data to be consistent with its intended specification.

### Implementation Guidance

Converting data into normalized forms is one of most of effective mechanisms to stop malicious attacks and large classes of data exfiltration.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                             | Severity | Impact                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| AC-4(24) Internal Normalized Format not implemented | High     | Access Control            |
| AC-4(24) partially implemented                      | Medium   | Incomplete Access Control |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
