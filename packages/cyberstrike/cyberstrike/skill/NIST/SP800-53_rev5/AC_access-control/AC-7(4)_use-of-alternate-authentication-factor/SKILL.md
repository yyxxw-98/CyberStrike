# AC-7(4) Use of Alternate Authentication Factor

> **Enhancement of:** AC-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The use of alternate authentication factors supports the objective of availability and allows a user who has inadvertently been locked out to use additional authentication factors to bypass the lockout.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-7(4) Use of Alternate Authentication Factor is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 2 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-7(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-7(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Allow the use of [organization-defined] that are different from the primary authentication factors after the number of organization-defined consecutive invalid logon attempts have been exceeded; and
Enforce a limit of [organization-defined] consecutive invalid logon attempts through use of the alternative factors by a user during a [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

The use of alternate authentication factors supports the objective of availability and allows a user who has inadvertently been locked out to use additional authentication factors to bypass the lockout.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                        | Severity | Impact                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| AC-7(4) Use of Alternate Authentication Factor not implemented | High     | Access Control            |
| AC-7(4) partially implemented                                  | Medium   | Incomplete Access Control |

## CWE Categories
