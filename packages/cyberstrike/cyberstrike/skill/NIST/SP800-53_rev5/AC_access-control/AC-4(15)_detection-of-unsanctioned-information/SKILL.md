# AC-4(15) Detection of Unsanctioned Information

> **Enhancement of:** AC-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control (AC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Unsanctioned information includes malicious code, information that is inappropriate for release from the source network, or executable code that could disrupt or harm the services or systems on the destination network.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AC-4(15) Detection of Unsanctioned Information is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AC-4(15)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AC-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AC-4(15) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                | Usage                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check IAM policies and access controls | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test web application access controls   | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

When transferring information between different security domains, examine the information for the presence of [organization-defined] and prohibit the transfer of such information in accordance with the [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Unsanctioned information includes malicious code, information that is inappropriate for release from the source network, or executable code that could disrupt or harm the services or systems on the destination network.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                        | Severity | Impact                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| AC-4(15) Detection of Unsanctioned Information not implemented | High     | Access Control            |
| AC-4(15) partially implemented                                 | Medium   | Incomplete Access Control |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control |
