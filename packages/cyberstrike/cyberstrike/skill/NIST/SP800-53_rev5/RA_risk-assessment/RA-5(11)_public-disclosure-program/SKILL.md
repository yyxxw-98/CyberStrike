# RA-5(11) Public Disclosure Program

> **Enhancement of:** RA-5

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Risk Assessment (RA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the organization. The organization does not condition its authorization on an expectation of indefinite non-disclosure to the public by the reporting entity but may request a specific time period to properly remediate the vulnerability.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify RA-5(11) Public Disclosure Program is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for RA-5(11)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control RA-5

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for RA-5(11) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.

### Implementation Guidance

The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the organization. The organization does not condition its authorization on an expectation of indefinite non-disclosure to the public by the reporting entity but may request a specific time period to properly remediate the vulnerability.

| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| RA-5(11) Public Disclosure Program not implemented | Medium   | Risk Assessment            |
| RA-5(11) partially implemented                     | Low      | Incomplete Risk Assessment |
