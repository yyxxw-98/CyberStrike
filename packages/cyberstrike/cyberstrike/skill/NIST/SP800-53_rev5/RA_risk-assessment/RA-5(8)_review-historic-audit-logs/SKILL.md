# RA-5(8) Review Historic Audit Logs

> **Enhancement of:** RA-5

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Risk Assessment (RA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Reviewing historic audit logs to determine if a recently detected vulnerability in a system has been previously exploited by an adversary can provide important information for forensic analyses. Such analyses can help identify, for example, the extent of a previous intrusion, the trade craft employed during the attack, organizational information exfiltrated or modified, mission or business capabilities affected, and the duration of the attack.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify RA-5(8) Review Historic Audit Logs is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for RA-5(8)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control RA-5

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for RA-5(8) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Review historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in a [organization-defined] has been previously exploited within an [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Reviewing historic audit logs to determine if a recently detected vulnerability in a system has been previously exploited by an adversary can provide important information for forensic analyses. Such analyses can help identify, for example, the extent of a previous intrusion, the trade craft employed during the attack, organizational information exfiltrated or modified, mission or business capabilities affected, and the duration of the attack.
