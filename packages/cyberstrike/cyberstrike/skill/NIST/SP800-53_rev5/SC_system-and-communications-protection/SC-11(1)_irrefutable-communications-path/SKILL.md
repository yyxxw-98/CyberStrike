# SC-11(1) Irrefutable Communications Path

> **Enhancement of:** SC-11

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as a trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display that other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be spoofed.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-11(1) Irrefutable Communications Path is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 2 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-11(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-11

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-11(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide a trusted communications path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communications paths; and
Initiate the trusted communications path for communications between the [organization-defined] of the system and the user.

### Implementation Guidance

An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as a trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display that other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be spoofed.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                  | Severity | Impact                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SC-11(1) Irrefutable Communications Path not implemented | High     | System and Communications Protection            |
| SC-11(1) partially implemented                           | Medium   | Incomplete System and Communications Protection |
