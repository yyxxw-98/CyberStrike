# SC-42(5) Collection Minimization

> **Enhancement of:** SC-42

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Although policies to control for authorized use can be applied to information once it is collected, minimizing the collection of information that is not needed mitigates privacy risk at the system entry point and mitigates the risk of policy control failures. Sensor configurations include the obscuring of human features, such as blurring or pixelating flesh tones.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-42(5) Collection Minimization is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-42(5)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-42

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-42(5) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Employ [organization-defined] that are configured to minimize the collection of information about individuals that is not needed.

### Implementation Guidance

Although policies to control for authorized use can be applied to information once it is collected, minimizing the collection of information that is not needed mitigates privacy risk at the system entry point and mitigates the risk of policy control failures. Sensor configurations include the obscuring of human features, such as blurring or pixelating flesh tones.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                          | Severity | Impact                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SC-42(5) Collection Minimization not implemented | High     | System and Communications Protection            |
| SC-42(5) partially implemented                   | Medium   | Incomplete System and Communications Protection |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                                |

| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data |
