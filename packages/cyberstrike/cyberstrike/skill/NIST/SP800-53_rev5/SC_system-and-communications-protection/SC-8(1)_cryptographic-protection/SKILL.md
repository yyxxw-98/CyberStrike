# SC-8(1) Cryptographic Protection

> **Enhancement of:** SC-8

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-8(1) Cryptographic Protection is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-8(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-8

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-8(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [organization-defined] during transmission.

### Implementation Guidance

Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                          | Severity | Impact                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SC-8(1) Cryptographic Protection not implemented | High     | System and Communications Protection            |
| SC-8(1) partially implemented                    | Medium   | Incomplete System and Communications Protection |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data |
