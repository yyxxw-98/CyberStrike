# SC-7(17) Automated Enforcement of Protocol Formats

> **Enhancement of:** SC-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

System components that enforce protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. The components verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layers.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-7(17) Automated Enforcement of Protocol Formats is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-7(17)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-7(17) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Enforce adherence to protocol formats.

### Implementation Guidance

System components that enforce protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. The components verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layers.
