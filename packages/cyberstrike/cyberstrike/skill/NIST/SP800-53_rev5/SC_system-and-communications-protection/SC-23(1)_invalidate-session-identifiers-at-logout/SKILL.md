# SC-23(1) Invalidate Session Identifiers at Logout

> **Enhancement of:** SC-23

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-23(1) Invalidate Session Identifiers at Logout is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-23(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-23

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-23(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.

### Implementation Guidance

Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.
