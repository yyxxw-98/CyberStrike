# SC-28(3) Cryptographic Keys

> **Enhancement of:** SC-28

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an example of a hardware-protected data store that can be used to protect cryptographic keys.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-28(3) Cryptographic Keys is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-28(3)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-28

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-28(3) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide protected storage for cryptographic keys [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an example of a hardware-protected data store that can be used to protect cryptographic keys.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                     | Severity | Impact                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SC-28(3) Cryptographic Keys not implemented | High     | System and Communications Protection            |
| SC-28(3) partially implemented              | Medium   | Incomplete System and Communications Protection |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                                |
