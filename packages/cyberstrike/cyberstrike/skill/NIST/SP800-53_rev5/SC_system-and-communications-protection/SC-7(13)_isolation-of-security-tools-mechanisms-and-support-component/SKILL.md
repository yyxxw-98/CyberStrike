# SC-7(13) Isolation of Security Tools, Mechanisms, and Support Components

> **Enhancement of:** SC-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Communications Protection (SC)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques employed by organizations.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SC-7(13) Isolation of Security Tools, Mechanisms, and Support Components is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SC-7(13)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SC-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SC-7(13) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                               | Usage                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check encryption and network controls | `cloud_audit_encryption`             |
| nmap            | Network scanning                      | `nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Isolate [organization-defined] from other internal system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

### Implementation Guidance

Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques employed by organizations.
