# CM-2(3) Retention of Previous Configurations

> **Enhancement of:** CM-2

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Configuration Management (CM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback include hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, configuration records, and associated documentation.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CM-2(3) Retention of Previous Configurations is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CM-2(3)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CM-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CM-2(3) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check configuration baselines | `cloud_audit_config`                      |
| AWS CLI         | Review Config rules           | `aws configservice describe-config-rules` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Retain [organization-defined] of previous versions of baseline configurations of the system to support rollback.

### Implementation Guidance

Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback include hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, configuration records, and associated documentation.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                      | Severity | Impact                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CM-2(3) Retention of Previous Configurations not implemented | Medium   | Configuration Management            |
| CM-2(3) partially implemented                                | Low      | Incomplete Configuration Management |
