# CM-7(4) Unauthorized Software — Deny-by-exception

> **Enhancement of:** CM-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Configuration Management (CM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Unauthorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. The concept of prohibiting the execution of unauthorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CM-7(4) Unauthorized Software — Deny-by-exception is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CM-7(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CM-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CM-7(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check configuration baselines | `cloud_audit_config`                      |
| AWS CLI         | Review Config rules           | `aws configservice describe-config-rules` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Identify [organization-defined];
Employ an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on the system; and
Review and update the list of unauthorized software programs [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Unauthorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. The concept of prohibiting the execution of unauthorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses.

| Finding                                                           | Severity | Impact                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CM-7(4) Unauthorized Software — Deny-by-exception not implemented | Medium   | Configuration Management            |
| CM-7(4) partially implemented                                     | Low      | Incomplete Configuration Management |
