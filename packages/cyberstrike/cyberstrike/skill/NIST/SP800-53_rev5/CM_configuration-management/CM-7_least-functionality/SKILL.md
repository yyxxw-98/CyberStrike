# CM-7 Least Functionality

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Configuration Management (CM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see [SA-8](#sa-8), [SC-2](#sc-2) , and [SC-3](#sc-3)).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CM-7 Least Functionality is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 2 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CM-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CM-7 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check configuration baselines | `cloud_audit_config`                      |
| AWS CLI         | Review Config rules           | `aws configservice describe-config-rules` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Configure the system to provide only [organization-defined] ; and
Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services: [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see [SA-8](#sa-8), [SC-2](#sc-2) , and [SC-3](#sc-3)).

| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CM-7 Least Functionality not implemented | Medium   | Configuration Management            |
| CM-7 partially implemented               | Low      | Incomplete Configuration Management |
