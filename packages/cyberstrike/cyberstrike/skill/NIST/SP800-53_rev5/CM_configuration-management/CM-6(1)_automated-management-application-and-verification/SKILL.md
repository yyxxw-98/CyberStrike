# CM-6(1) Automated Management, Application, and Verification

> **Enhancement of:** CM-6

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Configuration Management (CM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CM-6(1) Automated Management, Application, and Verification is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CM-6(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CM-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CM-6(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check configuration baselines | `cloud_audit_config`                      |
| AWS CLI         | Review Config rules           | `aws configservice describe-config-rules` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for [organization-defined] using [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.
