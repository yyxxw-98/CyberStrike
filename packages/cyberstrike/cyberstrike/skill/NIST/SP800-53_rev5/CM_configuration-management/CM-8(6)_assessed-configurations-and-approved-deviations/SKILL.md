# CM-8(6) Assessed Configurations and Approved Deviations

> **Enhancement of:** CM-8

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Configuration Management (CM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Assessed configurations and approved deviations focus on configuration settings established by organizations for system components, the specific components that have been assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved deviations from established configuration settings.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CM-8(6) Assessed Configurations and Approved Deviations is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CM-8(6)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CM-8

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CM-8(6) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check configuration baselines | `cloud_audit_config`                      |
| AWS CLI         | Review Config rules           | `aws configservice describe-config-rules` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Include assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to current deployed configurations in the system component inventory.

### Implementation Guidance

Assessed configurations and approved deviations focus on configuration settings established by organizations for system components, the specific components that have been assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved deviations from established configuration settings.
