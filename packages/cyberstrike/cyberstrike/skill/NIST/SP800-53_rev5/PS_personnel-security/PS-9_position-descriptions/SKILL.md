# PS-9 Position Descriptions

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Personnel Security (PS)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Specification of security and privacy roles in individual organizational position descriptions facilitates clarity in understanding the security or privacy responsibilities associated with the roles and the role-based security and privacy training requirements for the roles.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PS-9 Position Descriptions is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PS-9

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PS-9 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.
