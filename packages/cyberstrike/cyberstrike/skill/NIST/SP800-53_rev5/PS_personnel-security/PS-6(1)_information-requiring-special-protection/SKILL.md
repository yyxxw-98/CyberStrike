# PS-6(1) Information Requiring Special Protection

> **Enhancement of:** PS-6

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Personnel Security (PS)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

No description available.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PS-6(1) Information Requiring Special Protection is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PS-6(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control PS-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PS-6(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.
