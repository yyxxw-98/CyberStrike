# CP-7(4) Preparation for Use

> **Enhancement of:** CP-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Contingency Planning (CP)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Site preparation includes establishing configuration settings for systems at the alternate processing site consistent with the requirements for such settings at the primary site and ensuring that essential supplies and logistical considerations are in place.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CP-7(4) Preparation for Use is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CP-7(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CP-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CP-7(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Prepare the alternate processing site so that the site can serve as the operational site supporting essential mission and business functions.

### Implementation Guidance

Site preparation includes establishing configuration settings for systems at the alternate processing site consistent with the requirements for such settings at the primary site and ensuring that essential supplies and logistical considerations are in place.
