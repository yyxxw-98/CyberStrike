# CP-2(1) Coordinate with Related Plans

> **Enhancement of:** CP-2

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Contingency Planning (CP)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Plans that are related to contingency plans include Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Insider Threat Implementation Plans, Data Breach Response Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, Breach Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CP-2(1) Coordinate with Related Plans is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CP-2(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CP-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CP-2(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.
