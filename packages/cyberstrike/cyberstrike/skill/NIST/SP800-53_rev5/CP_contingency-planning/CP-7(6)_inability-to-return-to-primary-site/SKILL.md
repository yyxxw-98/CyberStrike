# CP-7(6) Inability to Return to Primary Site

> **Enhancement of:** CP-7

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Contingency Planning (CP)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

There may be situations that preclude an organization from returning to the primary processing site such as if a natural disaster (e.g., flood or a hurricane) damaged or destroyed a facility and it was determined that rebuilding in the same location was not prudent.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CP-7(6) Inability to Return to Primary Site is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CP-7(6)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CP-7

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CP-7(6) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Plan and prepare for circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site.

### Implementation Guidance

There may be situations that preclude an organization from returning to the primary processing site such as if a natural disaster (e.g., flood or a hurricane) damaged or destroyed a facility and it was determined that rebuilding in the same location was not prudent.
