# PM-4 Plan of Action and Milestones Process

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Program Management (PM)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The plan of action and milestones is a key organizational document and is subject to reporting requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget. Organizations develop plans of action and milestones with an organization-wide perspective, prioritizing risk response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from control assessments and continuous monitoring activities. There can be multiple plans of action and milestones corresponding to the information system level, mission/business process level, and organizational/governance level. While plans of action and milestones are required for federal organizations, other types of organizations can help reduce risk by documenting and tracking planned remediations. Specific guidance on plans of action and milestones at the system level is provided in [CA-5](#ca-5).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PM-4 Plan of Action and Milestones Process is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PM-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PM-4 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Implement a process to ensure that plans of action and milestones for the information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management programs and associated organizational systems:
Are developed and maintained;
Document the remedial information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management actions to adequately respond to risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
Are reported in accordance with established reporting requirements.
Review plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.
