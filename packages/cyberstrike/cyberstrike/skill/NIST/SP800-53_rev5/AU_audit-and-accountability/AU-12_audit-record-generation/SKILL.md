# AU-12 Audit Record Generation

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Audit and Accountability (AU)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AU-12 Audit Record Generation is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AU-12

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AU-12 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check logging configuration  | `cloud_audit_logging`            |
| AWS CLI         | Review CloudTrail/CloudWatch | `aws cloudtrail describe-trails` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on [organization-defined];
Allow [organization-defined] to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and
Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).

### Implementation Guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                       | Severity | Impact                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AU-12 Audit Record Generation not implemented | Medium   | Audit and Accountability            |
| AU-12 partially implemented                   | Low      | Incomplete Audit and Accountability |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                |
