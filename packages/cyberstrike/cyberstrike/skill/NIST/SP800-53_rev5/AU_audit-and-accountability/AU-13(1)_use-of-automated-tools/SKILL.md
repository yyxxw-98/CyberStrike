# AU-13(1) Use of Automated Tools

> **Enhancement of:** AU-13

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Audit and Accountability (AU)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Automated mechanisms include commercial services that provide notifications and alerts to organizations and automated scripts to monitor new posts on websites.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AU-13(1) Use of Automated Tools is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AU-13(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AU-13

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AU-13(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check logging configuration  | `cloud_audit_logging`            |
| AWS CLI         | Review CloudTrail/CloudWatch | `aws cloudtrail describe-trails` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Monitor open-source information and information sites using [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Automated mechanisms include commercial services that provide notifications and alerts to organizations and automated scripts to monitor new posts on websites.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                         | Severity | Impact                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AU-13(1) Use of Automated Tools not implemented | Medium   | Audit and Accountability            |
| AU-13(1) partially implemented                  | Low      | Incomplete Audit and Accountability |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                |
