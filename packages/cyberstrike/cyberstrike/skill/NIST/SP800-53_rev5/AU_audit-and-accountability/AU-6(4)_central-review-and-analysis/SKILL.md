# AU-6(4) Central Review and Analysis

> **Enhancement of:** AU-6

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Audit and Accountability (AU)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include Security Information and Event Management products.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AU-6(4) Central Review and Analysis is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AU-6(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AU-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AU-6(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check logging configuration  | `cloud_audit_logging`            |
| AWS CLI         | Review CloudTrail/CloudWatch | `aws cloudtrail describe-trails` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide and implement the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from multiple components within the system.

### Implementation Guidance

Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include Security Information and Event Management products.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                             | Severity | Impact                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AU-6(4) Central Review and Analysis not implemented | Medium   | Audit and Accountability            |
| AU-6(4) partially implemented                       | Low      | Incomplete Audit and Accountability |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| CWE-778 | Insufficient Logging |
