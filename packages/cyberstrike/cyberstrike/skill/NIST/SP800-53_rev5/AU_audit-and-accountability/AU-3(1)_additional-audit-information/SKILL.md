# AU-3(1) Additional Audit Information

> **Enhancement of:** AU-3

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Audit and Accountability (AU)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional information in audit records including, but not limited to, access control or flow control rules invoked and individual identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading, make it more difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the risk to individuals' privacy.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AU-3(1) Additional Audit Information is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AU-3(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AU-3

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AU-3(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check logging configuration  | `cloud_audit_logging`            |
| AWS CLI         | Review CloudTrail/CloudWatch | `aws cloudtrail describe-trails` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Generate audit records containing the following additional information: [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional information in audit records including, but not limited to, access control or flow control rules invoked and individual identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements.
