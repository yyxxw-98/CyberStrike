# MP-6(2) Equipment Testing

> **Enhancement of:** MP-6

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Media Protection (MP)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Testing of sanitization equipment and procedures may be conducted by qualified and authorized external entities, including federal agencies or external service providers.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify MP-6(2) Equipment Testing is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for MP-6(2)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control MP-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for MP-6(2) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.
