# MP-8 Media Downgrading

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Media Protection (MP)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify MP-8 Media Downgrading is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 4 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for MP-8

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for MP-8 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Establish [organization-defined] that includes employing downgrading mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information;
Verify that the system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information;
Identify [organization-defined] ; and
Downgrade the identified system media using the established process.

### Implementation Guidance

Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                | Severity | Impact                      |

| MP-8 Media Downgrading not implemented | Medium   | Media Protection            |
| MP-8 partially implemented             | Low      | Incomplete Media Protection |
