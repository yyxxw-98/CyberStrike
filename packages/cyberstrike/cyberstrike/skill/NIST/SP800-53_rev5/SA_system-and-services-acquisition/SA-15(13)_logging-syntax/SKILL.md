# SA-15(13) Logging Syntax

> **Enhancement of:** SA-15

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Services Acquisition (SA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

In support of better incident response and the ability to more quickly reconstruct security-related actions, identifying specific requirements for secure logging facilitates the ability to connect application-produced audit event logs with operational data. Event types are consistent with the event types defined in [AU-02](#au-2).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SA-15(13) Logging Syntax is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SA-15(13)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SA-15

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SA-15(13) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally identifiable information in development and test environments.

### Implementation Guidance

In support of better incident response and the ability to more quickly reconstruct security-related actions, identifying specific requirements for secure logging facilitates the ability to connect application-produced audit event logs with operational data. Event types are consistent with the event types defined in [AU-02](#au-2).
