# SA-14 Criticality Analysis

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Services Acquisition (SA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

No description available.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SA-14 Criticality Analysis is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SA-14

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SA-14 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Refer to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 for the full control statement.

### Implementation Guidance

Implement this control per organizational risk assessment and system categorization.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                    | Severity | Impact                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| SA-14 Criticality Analysis not implemented | Medium   | System and Services Acquisition            |
| SA-14 partially implemented                | Low      | Incomplete System and Services Acquisition |
