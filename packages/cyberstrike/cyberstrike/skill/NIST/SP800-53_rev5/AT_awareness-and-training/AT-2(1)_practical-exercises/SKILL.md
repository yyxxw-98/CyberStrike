# AT-2(1) Practical Exercises

> **Enhancement of:** AT-2

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Awareness and Training (AT)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Practical exercises include no-notice social engineering attempts to collect information, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify AT-2(1) Practical Exercises is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for AT-2(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control AT-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for AT-2(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide practical exercises in literacy training that simulate events and incidents.

### Implementation Guidance

Practical exercises include no-notice social engineering attempts to collect information, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links.
