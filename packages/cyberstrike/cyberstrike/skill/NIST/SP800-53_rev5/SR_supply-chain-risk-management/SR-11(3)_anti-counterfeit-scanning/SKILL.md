# SR-11(3) Anti-counterfeit Scanning

> **Enhancement of:** SR-11

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The type of component determines the type of scanning to be conducted (e.g., web application scanning if the component is a web application).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SR-11(3) Anti-counterfeit Scanning is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SR-11(3)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SR-11

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SR-11(3) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Scan for counterfeit system components [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

The type of component determines the type of scanning to be conducted (e.g., web application scanning if the component is a web application).

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                            | Severity | Impact                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SR-11(3) Anti-counterfeit Scanning not implemented | Medium   | Supply Chain Risk Management            |
| SR-11(3) partially implemented                     | Low      | Incomplete Supply Chain Risk Management |
