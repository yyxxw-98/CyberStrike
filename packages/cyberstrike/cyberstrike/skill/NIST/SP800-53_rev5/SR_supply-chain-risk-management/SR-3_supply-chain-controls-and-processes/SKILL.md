# SR-3 Supply Chain Controls and Processes

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools employed for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions. Supply chain personnel are individuals with roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SR-3 Supply Chain Controls and Processes is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SR-3

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SR-3 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Establish a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of [organization-defined] in coordination with [organization-defined];
Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: [organization-defined] ; and
Document the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls in [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools employed for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions. Supply chain personnel are individuals with roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                  | Severity | Impact                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SR-3 Supply Chain Controls and Processes not implemented | Medium   | Supply Chain Risk Management            |
| SR-3 partially implemented                               | Low      | Incomplete Supply Chain Risk Management |
