# PE-3(1) System Access

> **Enhancement of:** PE-3

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PE-3(1) System Access is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PE-3(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control PE-3

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PE-3(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.
