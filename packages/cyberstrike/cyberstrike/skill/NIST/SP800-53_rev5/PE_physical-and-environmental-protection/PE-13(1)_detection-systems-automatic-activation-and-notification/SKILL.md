# PE-13(1) Detection Systems — Automatic Activation and Notification

> **Enhancement of:** PE-13

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PE-13(1) Detection Systems — Automatic Activation and Notification is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PE-13(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control PE-13

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PE-13(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify [organization-defined] and [organization-defined] in the event of a fire.

### Implementation Guidance

Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.
