# PT-8 Computer Matching Requirements

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency (PT)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

The [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PT-8 Computer Matching Requirements is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 5 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PT-8

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PT-8 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

When a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program:
Obtain approval from the Data Integrity Board to conduct the matching program;
Develop and enter into a computer matching agreement;
Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register;
Independently verify the information produced by the matching program before taking adverse action against an individual, if required; and
Provide individuals with notice and an opportunity to contest the findings before taking adverse action against an individual.

### Implementation Guidance

The [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof).

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                             | Severity | Impact                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PT-8 Computer Matching Requirements not implemented | Medium   | Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency            |
| PT-8 partially implemented                          | Low      | Incomplete Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency |
