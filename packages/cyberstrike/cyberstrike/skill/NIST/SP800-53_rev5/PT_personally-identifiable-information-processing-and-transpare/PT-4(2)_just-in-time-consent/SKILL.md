# PT-4(2) Just-in-time Consent

> **Enhancement of:** PT-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency (PT)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Just-in-time consent enables individuals to participate in how their personally identifiable information is being processed at the time or in conjunction with specific types of data processing when such participation may be most useful to the individual. Individual assumptions about how personally identifiable information is being processed might not be accurate or reliable if time has passed since the individual last gave consent or the type of processing creates significant privacy risk. Organizations use discretion to determine when to use just-in-time consent and may use supporting information on demographics, focus groups, or surveys to learn more about individuals’ privacy interests and concerns.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PT-4(2) Just-in-time Consent is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for PT-4(2)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control PT-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for PT-4(2) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Present [organization-defined] to individuals at [organization-defined] and in conjunction with [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Just-in-time consent enables individuals to participate in how their personally identifiable information is being processed at the time or in conjunction with specific types of data processing when such participation may be most useful to the individual. Individual assumptions about how personally identifiable information is being processed might not be accurate or reliable if time has passed since the individual last gave consent or the type of processing creates significant privacy risk.
