# SI-19(5) Statistical Disclosure Control

> **Enhancement of:** SI-19

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Information Integrity (SI)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school that publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students enrolled, reports that it has 10-19 such students in January, and subsequently reports that it has 20-29 such students in March, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SI-19(5) Statistical Disclosure Control is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SI-19(5)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SI-19

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SI-19(5) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                    | Usage                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check integrity monitoring | `cloud_audit_monitoring`       |
| AWS CLI         | Review GuardDuty/Inspector | `aws guardduty list-detectors` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.

### Implementation Guidance

Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school that publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students enrolled, reports that it has 10-19 such students in January, and subsequently reports that it has 20-29 such students in March, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                 | Severity | Impact                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SI-19(5) Statistical Disclosure Control not implemented | High     | System and Information Integrity            |
| SI-19(5) partially implemented                          | Medium   | Incomplete System and Information Integrity |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID | Title                     |
