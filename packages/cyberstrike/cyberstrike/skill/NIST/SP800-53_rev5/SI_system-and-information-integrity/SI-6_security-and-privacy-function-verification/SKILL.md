# SI-6 Security and Privacy Function Verification

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Information Integrity (SI)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SI-6 Security and Privacy Function Verification is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 4 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SI-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SI-6 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                    | Usage                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check integrity monitoring | `cloud_audit_monitoring`       |
| AWS CLI         | Review GuardDuty/Inspector | `aws guardduty list-detectors` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Verify the correct operation of [organization-defined];
Perform the verification of the functions specified in SI-6a [organization-defined];
Alert [organization-defined] to failed security and privacy verification tests; and
[organization-defined] when anomalies are discovered.

### Implementation Guidance

Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                         | Severity | Impact                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SI-6 Security and Privacy Function Verification not implemented | High     | System and Information Integrity            |
| SI-6 partially implemented                                      | Medium   | Incomplete System and Information Integrity |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID | Title                     |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation |
