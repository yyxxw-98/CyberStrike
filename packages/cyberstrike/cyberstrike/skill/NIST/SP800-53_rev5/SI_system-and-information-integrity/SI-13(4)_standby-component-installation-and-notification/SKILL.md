# SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification

> **Enhancement of:** SI-13

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Information Integrity (SI)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 2 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SI-13(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SI-13

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SI-13(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                    | Usage                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check integrity monitoring | `cloud_audit_monitoring`       |
| AWS CLI         | Review GuardDuty/Inspector | `aws guardduty list-detectors` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

If system component failures are detected:
Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within [organization-defined] ; and
[organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.
