# SI-4(13) Analyze Traffic and Event Patterns

> **Enhancement of:** SI-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Information Integrity (SI)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Identifying and understanding common communications traffic and event patterns help organizations provide useful information to system monitoring devices to more effectively identify suspicious or anomalous traffic and events when they occur. Such information can help reduce the number of false positives and false negatives during system monitoring.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify SI-4(13) Analyze Traffic and Event Patterns is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for SI-4(13)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control SI-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for SI-4(13) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                    | Usage                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check integrity monitoring | `cloud_audit_monitoring`       |
| AWS CLI         | Review GuardDuty/Inspector | `aws guardduty list-detectors` |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Analyze communications traffic and event patterns for the system;
Develop profiles representing common traffic and event patterns; and
Use the traffic and event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices.

### Implementation Guidance

Identifying and understanding common communications traffic and event patterns help organizations provide useful information to system monitoring devices to more effectively identify suspicious or anomalous traffic and events when they occur. Such information can help reduce the number of false positives and false negatives during system monitoring.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                     | Severity | Impact                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SI-4(13) Analyze Traffic and Event Patterns not implemented | High     | System and Information Integrity            |
| SI-4(13) partially implemented                              | Medium   | Incomplete System and Information Integrity |

## CWE Categories
