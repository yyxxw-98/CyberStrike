# IR-2(2) Automated Training Environments

> **Enhancement of:** IR-2

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Incident Response (IR)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Automated mechanisms can provide a more thorough and realistic incident response training environment. This can be accomplished, for example, by providing more complete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic training scenarios and environments, and stressing the response capability.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify IR-2(2) Automated Training Environments is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for IR-2(2)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control IR-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for IR-2(2) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide an incident response training environment using [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Automated mechanisms can provide a more thorough and realistic incident response training environment. This can be accomplished, for example, by providing more complete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic training scenarios and environments, and stressing the response capability.
