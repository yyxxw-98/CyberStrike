# IR-2 Incident Response Training

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Incident Response (IR)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of [AT-2](#at-2) or [AT-3](#at-3) . Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify IR-2 Incident Response Training is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 4 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for IR-2

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for IR-2 implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:
Within [organization-defined] of assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access;
When required by system changes; and
[organization-defined] thereafter; and
Review and update incident response training content [organization-defined] and following [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of [AT-2](#at-2) or [AT-3](#at-3) . Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

| Finding                                         | Severity | Impact                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| IR-2 Incident Response Training not implemented | Medium   | Incident Response            |
| IR-2 partially implemented                      | Low      | Incomplete Incident Response |
