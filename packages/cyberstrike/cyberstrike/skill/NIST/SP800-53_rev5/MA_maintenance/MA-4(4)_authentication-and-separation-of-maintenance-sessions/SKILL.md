# MA-4(4) Authentication and Separation of Maintenance Sessions

> **Enhancement of:** MA-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Maintenance (MA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Communications paths can be logically separated using encryption.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify MA-4(4) Authentication and Separation of Maintenance Sessions is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 3 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for MA-4(4)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control MA-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for MA-4(4) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Protect nonlocal maintenance sessions by:
Employing [organization-defined] ; and
Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the system by either:
Physically separated communications paths; or
Logically separated communications paths.

### Implementation Guidance

Communications paths can be logically separated using encryption.
