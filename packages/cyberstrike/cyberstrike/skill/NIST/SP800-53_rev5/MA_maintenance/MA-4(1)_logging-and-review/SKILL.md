# MA-4(1) Logging and Review

> **Enhancement of:** MA-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Maintenance (MA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Audit logging for nonlocal maintenance is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify MA-4(1) Logging and Review is documented in SSP
- [ ] Validate all 2 control requirements are implemented
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for MA-4(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control MA-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for MA-4(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Log [organization-defined] for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions; and
Review the audit records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions to detect anomalous behavior.

### Implementation Guidance

Audit logging for nonlocal maintenance is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                    | Severity | Impact                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| MA-4(1) Logging and Review not implemented | Medium   | Maintenance            |
| MA-4(1) partially implemented              | Low      | Incomplete Maintenance |
