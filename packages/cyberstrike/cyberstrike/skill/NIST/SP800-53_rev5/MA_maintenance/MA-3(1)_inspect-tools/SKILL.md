# MA-3(1) Inspect Tools

> **Enhancement of:** MA-3

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Maintenance (MA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance personnel or downloaded from a vendor’s website. If, upon inspection of the maintenance tools, organizations determine that the tools have been modified in an improper manner or the tools contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with organizational policies and procedures for incident handling.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify MA-3(1) Inspect Tools is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for MA-3(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control MA-3

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for MA-3(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Inspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications.

### Implementation Guidance

Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance personnel or downloaded from a vendor’s website. If, upon inspection of the maintenance tools, organizations determine that the tools have been modified in an improper manner or the tools contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with organizational policies and procedures for incident handling.
