# CA-3(5) Restrictions on External System Connections

> **Enhancement of:** CA-3

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring (CA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

No description available.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CA-3(5) Restrictions on External System Connections is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CA-3(5)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CA-3

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CA-3(5) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool          | Purpose                           | Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Manual Review | Documentation and interview-based | N/A   |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Refer to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 for the full control statement.

### Implementation Guidance

Implement this control per organizational risk assessment and system categorization.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                             | Severity | Impact                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CA-3(5) Restrictions on External System Connections not implemented | Medium   | Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring            |
| CA-3(5) partially implemented                                       | Low      | Incomplete Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring |
