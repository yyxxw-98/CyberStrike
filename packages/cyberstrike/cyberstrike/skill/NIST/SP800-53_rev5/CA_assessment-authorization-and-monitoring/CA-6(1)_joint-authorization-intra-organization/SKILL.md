# CA-6(1) Joint Authorization — Intra-organization

> **Enhancement of:** CA-6

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring (CA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

Assigning multiple authorizing officials from the same organization to serve as co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of independence in the risk-based decision-making process. It also implements the concepts of separation of duties and dual authorization as applied to the system authorization process. The intra-organization joint authorization process is most relevant for connected systems, shared systems, and systems with multiple information owners.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify CA-6(1) Joint Authorization — Intra-organization is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for CA-6(1)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control CA-6

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for CA-6(1) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Employ a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing officials from the same organization conducting the authorization.

### Implementation Guidance

Assigning multiple authorizing officials from the same organization to serve as co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of independence in the risk-based decision-making process. It also implements the concepts of separation of duties and dual authorization as applied to the system authorization process. The intra-organization joint authorization process is most relevant for connected systems, shared systems, and systems with multiple information owners.
