# IA-4(9) Attribute Maintenance and Protection

> **Enhancement of:** IA-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Identification and Authentication (IA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

For each of the entities covered in [IA-2](#ia-2), [IA-3](#ia-3), [IA-8](#ia-8) , and [IA-9](#ia-9) , it is important to maintain the attributes for each authenticated entity on an ongoing basis in a central (protected) store.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify IA-4(9) Attribute Maintenance and Protection is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for IA-4(9)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control IA-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for IA-4(9) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                        | Usage                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check authentication settings  | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test authentication mechanisms | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Maintain the attributes for each uniquely identified individual, device, or service in [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

For each of the entities covered in [IA-2](#ia-2), [IA-3](#ia-3), [IA-8](#ia-8) , and [IA-9](#ia-9) , it is important to maintain the attributes for each authenticated entity on an ongoing basis in a central (protected) store.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                      | Severity | Impact                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| IA-4(9) Attribute Maintenance and Protection not implemented | High     | Identification and Authentication            |
| IA-4(9) partially implemented                                | Medium   | Incomplete Identification and Authentication |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication |
