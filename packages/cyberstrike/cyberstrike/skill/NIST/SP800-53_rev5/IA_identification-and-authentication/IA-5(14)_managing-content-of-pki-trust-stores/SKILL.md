# IA-5(14) Managing Content of PKI Trust Stores

> **Enhancement of:** IA-5

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Identification and Authentication (IA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

An organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores helps improve the accuracy and currency of PKI-based authentication credentials across the organization.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify IA-5(14) Managing Content of PKI Trust Stores is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for IA-5(14)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control IA-5

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for IA-5(14) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                        | Usage                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check authentication settings  | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test authentication mechanisms | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

For PKI-based authentication, employ an organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms, including networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.

### Implementation Guidance

An organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores helps improve the accuracy and currency of PKI-based authentication credentials across the organization.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                       | Severity | Impact                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| IA-5(14) Managing Content of PKI Trust Stores not implemented | High     | Identification and Authentication            |
| IA-5(14) partially implemented                                | Medium   | Incomplete Identification and Authentication |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                   |
