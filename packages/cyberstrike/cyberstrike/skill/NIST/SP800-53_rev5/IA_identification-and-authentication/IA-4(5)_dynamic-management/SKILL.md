# IA-4(5) Dynamic Management

> **Enhancement of:** IA-4

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Identification and Authentication (IA)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

In contrast to conventional approaches to identification that presume static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed systems establish identifiers at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. When identifiers are established at runtime for previously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate credentials and related identifiers are essential.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify IA-4(5) Dynamic Management is documented in SSP
- [ ] Confirm control is operating effectively
- [ ] Review evidence of continuous monitoring for IA-4(5)
- [ ] Verify enhancement builds upon base control IA-4

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review Documentation

Examine the System Security Plan (SSP) and related artifacts for IA-4(5) implementation details. Verify the organization has documented how this control is satisfied.

### Step 2: Validate Implementation

```
# For cloud environments, use cloud-audit-mcp tools
# For on-premises, review system configurations directly

# Example: Check if account management policies exist
grep -r "account.management\|access.control" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Test Operating Effectiveness

Verify the control is actively functioning, not just documented. Check logs, configurations, and operational evidence.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                        | Usage                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Check authentication settings  | `cloud_audit_iam_policies` |
| hackbrowser-mcp | Test authentication mechanisms | `browser_auth_test`        |

## Remediation Guide

### Control Statement

Manage individual identifiers dynamically in accordance with [organization-defined].

### Implementation Guidance

In contrast to conventional approaches to identification that presume static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed systems establish identifiers at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. When identifiers are established at runtime for previously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate credentials and related identifiers are essential.

| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| IA-4(5) Dynamic Management not implemented | High     | Identification and Authentication            |
| IA-4(5) partially implemented              | Medium   | Incomplete Identification and Authentication |
