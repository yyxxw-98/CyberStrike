# Flaw Remediation (03.14.01) Flaw Remediation

## High-Level Description

**Family:** System and Information Integrity
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

Identify, report, and correct system flaws.
Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [organization-defined] of the release of the updates.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Flaw Remediation (03.14.01) Flaw Remediation is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for Flaw Remediation (03.14.01)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for Flaw Remediation (03.14.01)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for Flaw Remediation (03.14.01)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for Flaw Remediation (03.14.01) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Identify, report, and correct system flaws.
Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [organization-defined] of the release of the updates.

### Supplemental Guidance

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources (e.g., CWE or CVE databases) when remediating system flaws. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                      | Severity | Impact                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Flaw Remediation (03.14.01) Flaw Remediation not implemented | High     | CUI Protection - System and Information Integrity |
| Flaw Remediation (03.14.01) partially implemented (POA&M)    | Medium   | CMMC certification risk                           |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID | Title                     |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation |
