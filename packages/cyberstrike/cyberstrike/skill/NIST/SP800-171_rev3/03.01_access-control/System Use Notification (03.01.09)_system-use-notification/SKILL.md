# System Use Notification (03.01.09) System Use Notification

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Access Control
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

System Use Notification

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify System Use Notification (03.01.09) System Use Notification is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for System Use Notification (03.01.09)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for System Use Notification (03.01.09)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for System Use Notification (03.01.09)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for System Use Notification (03.01.09) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Implement System Use Notification per NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3.

### Supplemental Guidance

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners. The messages or warning banners are displayed before individuals log in to a system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI. System use notifications are used for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when human interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider whether a secondary use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Posters or other printed materials may be used in lieu of an automated system message. This requirement is related to [](#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_171_3_0_0/home?element=03.15.03) 03.15.03.
