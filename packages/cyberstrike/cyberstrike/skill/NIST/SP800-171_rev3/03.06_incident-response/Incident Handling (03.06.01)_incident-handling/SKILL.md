# Incident Handling (03.06.01) Incident Handling

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Incident Response
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

Incident Handling

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Incident Handling (03.06.01) Incident Handling is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for Incident Handling (03.06.01)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for Incident Handling (03.06.01)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for Incident Handling (03.06.01)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for Incident Handling (03.06.01) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Implement Incident Handling per NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3.

### Supplemental Guidance

Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. An effective incident handling capability involves coordination among many organizational entities, including mission and business owners, system owners, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, and procurement offices.
