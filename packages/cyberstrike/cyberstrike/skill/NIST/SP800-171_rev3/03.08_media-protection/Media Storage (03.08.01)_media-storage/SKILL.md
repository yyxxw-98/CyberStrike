# Media Storage (03.08.01) Media Storage

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Media Protection
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

Media Storage

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Media Storage (03.08.01) Media Storage is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for Media Storage (03.08.01)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for Media Storage (03.08.01)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for Media Storage (03.08.01)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for Media Storage (03.08.01) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Implement Media Storage per NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3.

### Supplemental Guidance

System media include digital and non-digital media. Digital media include diskettes, flash drives, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media include paper and microfilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, establishing procedures to allow individuals to check out and return media to libraries, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. Controlled areas provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems. Sanitization techniques (e.g., destroying, cryptographically erasing, clearing, and purging) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals. The sanitization process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                | Severity | Impact                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Media Storage (03.08.01) Media Storage not implemented | Medium   | CUI Protection - Media Protection |
| Media Storage (03.08.01) partially implemented (POA&M) | Low      | CMMC certification risk           |
