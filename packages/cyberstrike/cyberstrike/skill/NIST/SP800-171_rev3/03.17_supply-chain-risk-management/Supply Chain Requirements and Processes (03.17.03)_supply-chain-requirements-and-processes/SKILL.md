# Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03) Supply Chain Requirements and Processes

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Supply Chain Risk Management
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes.
Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: [organization-defined].

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03) Supply Chain Requirements and Processes is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for Supply Chain Requirements and Processes (03.17.03) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes.
Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: [organization-defined].

### Supplemental Guidance

Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the research, development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes; shipping and handling procedures; physical security programs; personnel security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes are provided by organizations, system integrators, or external service providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.
