# Risk Response (03.11.04) Risk Response

## High-Level Description

**Family:** Risk Assessment
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Applicability:** Systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI

Risk Response

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Risk Response (03.11.04) Risk Response is implemented for CUI systems
- [ ] Review SSP documentation for Risk Response (03.11.04)
- [ ] Validate CMMC Level 2 assessment objective for Risk Response (03.11.04)
- [ ] Confirm POA&M addresses any gaps for Risk Response (03.11.04)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review System Security Plan

Examine the SSP for Risk Response (03.11.04) implementation description and responsible parties.

### Step 2: Assess Implementation

```
# Verify security controls protecting CUI
# Check access controls, encryption, monitoring as applicable

# For Linux systems:
ls -la /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "CUI\|controlled" /etc/security/ 2>/dev/null

# For cloud:
# Use cloud-audit-mcp tools to assess posture
```

### Step 3: CMMC Assessment Validation

Verify this requirement passes CMMC Level 2 assessment methodology per SP 800-171A Rev 3.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                      | Usage                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud CUI environment | `cloud_audit_*` tools  |
| Manual Review   | SSP and POA&M review         | Documentation analysis |

## Remediation Guide

### Requirement Statement

Implement Risk Response per NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3.

### Supplemental Guidance

This requirement addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones (POAM) entry. It may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a POAM entry is not needed. However, a POAM entry is generated if the risk response is to mitigate the identified risk and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately.

| Finding                                                | Severity | Impact                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Risk Response (03.11.04) Risk Response not implemented | Medium   | CUI Protection - Risk Assessment |
| Risk Response (03.11.04) partially implemented (POA&M) | Low      | CMMC certification risk          |
