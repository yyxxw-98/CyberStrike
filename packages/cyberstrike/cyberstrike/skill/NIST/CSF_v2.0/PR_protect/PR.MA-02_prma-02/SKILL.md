# PR.MA-02 PR.MA-02

> **Subcategory of:** Maintenance (PR.MA)

## High-Level Description

**Function:** PROTECT (PR)
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0

Remote maintenance of organizational assets is approved, logged, and performed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PR.MA-02 PR.MA-02 outcome is achieved
- [ ] Review documentation and evidence for PR.MA-02
- [ ] Assess organizational maturity for PROTECT function
- [ ] Map to SP 800-53 controls that satisfy PR.MA-02

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Current Profile

Determine the organization's current and target CSF profile tier for PR.MA-02.

### Step 2: Assess Outcome Achievement

```
# Review organizational policies and procedures
# Check for evidence that PR.MA-02 outcome is met
# Interview stakeholders responsible for PROTECT
```

### Step 3: Map to Technical Controls

Identify which SP 800-53 controls implement this CSF outcome and verify their operating effectiveness.
