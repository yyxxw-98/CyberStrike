# Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control

## High-Level Description

**Function:** PROTECT (PR)
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0

Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users, services, and hardware and managed commensurate with the assessed risk of unauthorized access

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control outcome is achieved
- [ ] Review documentation and evidence for Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA)
- [ ] Assess organizational maturity for PROTECT function

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Current Profile

Determine the organization's current and target CSF profile tier for Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA).

### Step 2: Assess Outcome Achievement

```
# Review organizational policies and procedures
# Check for evidence that Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) outcome is met
# Interview stakeholders responsible for PROTECT
```

### Step 3: Map to Technical Controls

Identify which SP 800-53 controls implement this CSF outcome and verify their operating effectiveness.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud security posture | `cloud_audit_*` tools        |
| Manual Review   | Policy and procedure review   | Interviews and documentation |

## Remediation Guide

Achieve the Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control outcome:

Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users, services, and hardware and managed commensurate with the assessed risk of unauthorized access
