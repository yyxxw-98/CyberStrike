# Detection Processes (DE.DP) Detection Processes

## High-Level Description

**Function:** DETECT (DE)
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0

Detection Processes

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Detection Processes (DE.DP) Detection Processes outcome is achieved
- [ ] Review documentation and evidence for Detection Processes (DE.DP)
- [ ] Assess organizational maturity for DETECT function

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Current Profile

Determine the organization's current and target CSF profile tier for Detection Processes (DE.DP).

### Step 2: Assess Outcome Achievement

```
# Review organizational policies and procedures
# Check for evidence that Detection Processes (DE.DP) outcome is met
# Interview stakeholders responsible for DETECT
```

### Step 3: Map to Technical Controls

Identify which SP 800-53 controls implement this CSF outcome and verify their operating effectiveness.

## Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                       | Usage                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| cloud-audit-mcp | Assess cloud security posture | `cloud_audit_*` tools        |
| Manual Review   | Policy and procedure review   | Interviews and documentation |

## Remediation Guide

Achieve the Detection Processes (DE.DP) Detection Processes outcome:

Implement controls that satisfy the Detection Processes outcome per NIST CSF v2.0.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                                                              | Severity | Impact              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Detection Processes (DE.DP) Detection Processes outcome not achieved | High     | DETECT Function Gap |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| CWE-778 | Insufficient Logging |
