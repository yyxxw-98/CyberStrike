# DE.AE-01 DE.AE-01

> **Subcategory of:** Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE)

## High-Level Description

**Function:** DETECT (DE)
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0

A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems is established and managed

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify DE.AE-01 DE.AE-01 outcome is achieved
- [ ] Review documentation and evidence for DE.AE-01
- [ ] Assess organizational maturity for DETECT function
- [ ] Map to SP 800-53 controls that satisfy DE.AE-01

## How to Test

### Step 1: Identify Current Profile

Determine the organization's current and target CSF profile tier for DE.AE-01.

### Step 2: Assess Outcome Achievement

```
# Review organizational policies and procedures
# Check for evidence that DE.AE-01 outcome is met
# Interview stakeholders responsible for DETECT
```

### Step 3: Map to Technical Controls

Identify which SP 800-53 controls implement this CSF outcome and verify their operating effectiveness.
