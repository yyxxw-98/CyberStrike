# Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3) Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Help reduce the frequency of vulnerabilities in the future.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3) Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3) Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes practice.
