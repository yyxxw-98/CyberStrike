# Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2) Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Help ensure that vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with risk to reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2) Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2) Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities practice.
