# RV.3.1 RV.3.1

> **Task of practice:** Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3)

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Analyze identified vulnerabilities to determine their root causes.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify RV.3.1 RV.3.1 is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for RV.3.1 implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of RV.3.1 practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows RV.3.1 RV.3.1 practice.

## Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                            | Usage                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| github-security-mcp | Check repository security settings | `github_security_*` tools    |
| Manual Review       | SDLC process review                | Documentation and interviews |

## Remediation Guide

Implement RV.3.1 RV.3.1 in the software development lifecycle:

Analyze identified vulnerabilities to determine their root causes.
