# PW.7.2 PW.7.2

> **Task of practice:** Review and/or Analyze Human-Readable Code to Identify Vulnerabilities and Verify Compliance with Security Requirements (PW.7)

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Perform the code review and/or code analysis based on the organization’s secure coding standards, and record and triage all discovered issues and recommended remediations in the development team’s workflow or issue tracking system.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PW.7.2 PW.7.2 is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for PW.7.2 implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of PW.7.2 practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows PW.7.2 PW.7.2 practice.
