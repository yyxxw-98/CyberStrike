## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Protect Software (PS)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Preserve software releases in order to help identify, analyze, and eliminate vulnerabilities discovered in the software after release.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Archive and Protect Each Software Release (PS.3) Archive and Protect Each Software Release is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Archive and Protect Each Software Release (PS.3) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Archive and Protect Each Software Release (PS.3) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
