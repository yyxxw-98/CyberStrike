# PO.5.2 PO.5.2

> **Task of practice:** Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5)

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Prepare the Organization (PO)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Secure and harden development endpoints (i.e., endpoints for software designers, developers, testers, builders, etc.) to perform development-related tasks using a risk-based approach.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PO.5.2 PO.5.2 is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for PO.5.2 implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of PO.5.2 practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows PO.5.2 PO.5.2 practice.

## Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                            | Usage                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| github-security-mcp | Check repository security settings | `github_security_*` tools    |
| Manual Review       | SDLC process review                | Documentation and interviews |

## Remediation Guide

Implement PO.5.2 PO.5.2 in the software development lifecycle:

Secure and harden development endpoints (i.e., endpoints for software designers, developers, testers, builders, etc.) to perform development-related tasks using a risk-based approach.

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                       | Severity | Impact                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PO.5.2 PO.5.2 not implemented | Medium   | Secure Development - Prepare the Organization |
