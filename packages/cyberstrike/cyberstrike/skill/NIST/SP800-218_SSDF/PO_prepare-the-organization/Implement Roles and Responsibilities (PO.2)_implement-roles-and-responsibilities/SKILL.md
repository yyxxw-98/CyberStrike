# Implement Roles and Responsibilities (PO.2) Implement Roles and Responsibilities

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Prepare the Organization (PO)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Ensure that everyone inside and outside of the organization involved in the SDLC is prepared to perform their SDLC-related roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Implement Roles and Responsibilities (PO.2) Implement Roles and Responsibilities is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Implement Roles and Responsibilities (PO.2) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Implement Roles and Responsibilities (PO.2) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Implement Roles and Responsibilities (PO.2) Implement Roles and Responsibilities practice.
