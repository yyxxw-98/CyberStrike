# PO.1.1 PO.1.1

> **Task of practice:** Define Security Requirements for Software Development (PO.1)

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Prepare the Organization (PO)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Identify and document all security requirements for the organization’s software development infrastructures and processes, and maintain the requirements over time.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify PO.1.1 PO.1.1 is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for PO.1.1 implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of PO.1.1 practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows PO.1.1 PO.1.1 practice.

## Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                            | Usage                        |
