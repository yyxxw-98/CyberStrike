# T0840 Network Connection Enumeration

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may perform network connection enumeration to discover information about device communication patterns. If an adversary can inspect the state of a network connection with tools, such as Netstat, in conjunction with System Firmware, then they can determine the role of certain devices on the network . The adversary can also use Network Sniffing to watch network traffic for details about the source, destination, protocol, and content.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Discovery (TA0102)

**Platforms:** ICS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Network Connection Enumeration technique is applicable to target ICS environment
- [ ] Check ICS/SCADA systems for indicators of Network Connection Enumeration
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target ICS/SCADA environment is susceptible to Network Connection Enumeration by examining operational technology systems and network architecture.

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T0840 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable in the ICS environment.

## Remediation Guide

### M0816 Mitigation Limited or Not Effective

Network connection enumeration is likely obtained by using common system tools (e.g., netstat, ipconfig).

## Detection

### Detection of Network Connection Enumeration

## Risk Assessment
