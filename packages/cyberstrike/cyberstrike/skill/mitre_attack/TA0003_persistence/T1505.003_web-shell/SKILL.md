# T1505.003 Web Shell

> **Sub-technique of:** T1505

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.

In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (e.g. China Chopper Web shell client).

## Kill Chain Phase

- Persistence (TA0003)

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Web Shell technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of Web Shell
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of Web Shell
- [ ] Check Network Devices systems for indicators of Web Shell
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (2 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Web Shell Written to Disk

This test simulates an adversary leveraging Web Shells by simulating the file modification to disk.
Idea from APTSimulator.
cmd.aspx source - https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmd.aspx

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```cmd
xcopy /I /Y "#{web_shells}" #{web_shell_path}
```

**Dependencies:**

- Web shell must exist on disk at specified location (#{web_shells})

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Web Shell by examining the target platforms (Linux, macOS, Network Devices).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1505.003 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

### M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or Program

Consider disabling functions from web technologies such as PHP’s `evaI()` that may be abused for web shells.

### M1018 User Account Management

Enforce the principle of least privilege by limiting privileges of user accounts so only authorized accounts can modify the web directory.

## Detection

### Web Shell Detection via Server Behavior and File Execution Chains

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                        | Severity | Impact      |

| Web Shell technique applicable | High     | Persistence |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID  | Title                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions |
