# T1546.007 Netsh Helper DLL

> **Sub-technique of:** T1546

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code>.

Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner. This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
- Persistence (TA0003)

**Platforms:** Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Netsh Helper DLL technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of Netsh Helper DLL
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Netsh Helper DLL Registration

You can register a "helper dll" with Netsh as a persistance mechanism. The code in the dll is executed every time netsh.exe is called.
The NetshHelper.dll provided with the atomic will simply launch notepad when netsh.exe is run.

[Sample DLL code](https://github.com/outflanknl/NetshHelperBeacon)

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```cmd
netsh.exe add helper "#{helper_file}"
taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f > NUL 2>&1
```

**Dependencies:**

- Helper DLL must exist on disk at specified location (#{helper_file})

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Netsh Helper DLL by examining the target platforms (Windows).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1546.007 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection
