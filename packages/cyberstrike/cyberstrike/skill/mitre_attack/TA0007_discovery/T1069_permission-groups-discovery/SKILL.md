# T1069 Permission Groups Discovery

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may attempt to discover group and permission settings. This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.

Adversaries may attempt to discover group permission settings in many different ways. This data may provide the adversary with information about the compromised environment that can be used in follow-on activity and targeting.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Discovery (TA0007)

**Platforms:** Containers, IaaS, Identity Provider, Linux, macOS, Office Suite, SaaS, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Permission Groups Discovery technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Containers systems for indicators of Permission Groups Discovery
- [ ] Check IaaS systems for indicators of Permission Groups Discovery
- [ ] Check Identity Provider systems for indicators of Permission Groups Discovery
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Permission Groups Discovery by examining the target platforms (Containers, IaaS, Identity Provider).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1069 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

> **Note**: No Atomic Red Team tests available for this technique. See [Atomic Red Team GitHub](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) for updates.

## Remediation Guide
