# T1619 Cloud Storage Object Discovery

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage. Similar to File and Directory Discovery on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e. Cloud Infrastructure Discovery) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.

Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage. Examples include ListObjectsV2 in AWS and List Blobs in Azure .

## Kill Chain Phase

- Discovery (TA0007)

**Platforms:** IaaS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Cloud Storage Object Discovery technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check IaaS systems for indicators of Cloud Storage Object Discovery
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Cloud Storage Object Discovery by examining the target platforms (IaaS).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1619 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

> **Note**: No Atomic Red Team tests available for this technique. See [Atomic Red Team GitHub](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) for updates.

## Remediation Guide

### M1018 User Account Management

Restrict granting of permissions related to listing objects in cloud storage to necessary accounts.
