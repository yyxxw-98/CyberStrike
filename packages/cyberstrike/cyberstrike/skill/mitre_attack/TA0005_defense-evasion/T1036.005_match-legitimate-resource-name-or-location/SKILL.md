# T1036.005 Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location

> **Sub-technique of:** T1036

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files, Registry keys, or other resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation.

This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: `svchost.exe`). Alternatively, a Windows Registry key may be given a close approximation to a key used by a legitimate program. In containerized environments, a threat actor may create a resource in a trusted namespace or one that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Defense Evasion (TA0005)

**Platforms:** Containers, ESXi, Linux, macOS, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Containers systems for indicators of Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location
- [ ] Check ESXi systems for indicators of Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (3 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Execute a process from a directory masquerading as the current parent directory

Create and execute a process from a directory masquerading as the current parent directory (`...` instead of normal `..`)

**Supported Platforms:** macos, linux

```bash
mkdir $HOME/...
cp $(which sh) $HOME/...
$HOME/.../sh -c "echo #{test_message}"
```

### Atomic Test 2: Masquerade as a built-in system executable

Launch an executable that attempts to masquerade as a legitimate executable.

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```powershell
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
public class Test {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("tweet, tweet");
    }
}
'@ -OutputAssembly "#{executable_filepath}"

Start-Process -FilePath "#{executable_filepath}"
```

### Atomic Test 3: Masquerading cmd.exe as VEDetector.exe

This test simulates an adversary renaming cmd.exe to VEDetector.exe to masquerade as a legitimate application.
The test copies cmd.exe, renames it to VEDetector.exe, adds a registry run key for persistence, and executes the renamed binary.
This technique may be used to evade detection by mimicking legitimate software names or locations.

**Expected Output:**

- A new process named VEDetector.exe appears in the process list, but its behavior matches cmd.exe.
- SIEM/EDR systems may detect this as suspicious process activity (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1 for process creation, or Event ID 13 for registry modifications).
- Registry modification in HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run may trigger persistence alerts in XDR platforms.

**References:**

- [MITRE ATT&CK T1036.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)
- [Sysmon Process Creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```powershell
# Copy and rename cmd.exe to VEDetector.exe
Copy-Item -Path "#{source_file}" -Destination "#{ved_path}\VEDetector.exe" -Force

# Create registry run key for persistence
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "VEDetector" -Value "#{ved_path}\VEDetector.exe" -PropertyType String -Force

# Start the renamed process
Start-Process -FilePath "#{ved_path}\VEDetector.exe"

Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
```

**Dependencies:**

- The source cmd.exe file must exist on the system.

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location by examining the target platforms (Containers, ESXi, Linux).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1036.005 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

### M1022 Restrict File and Directory Permissions

Use file system access controls to protect folders such as `C:\Windows\System32`.

### M1038 Execution Prevention

Use tools that restrict program execution via application control by attributes other than file name for common operating system utilities that are needed.

### M1045 Code Signing

Require signed binaries and images.
