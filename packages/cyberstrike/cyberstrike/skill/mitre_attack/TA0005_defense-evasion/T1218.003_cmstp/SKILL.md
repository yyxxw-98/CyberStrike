# T1218.003 CMSTP

> **Sub-technique of:** T1218

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. Similar to Regsvr32 / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other application control defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate binary that may be signed by Microsoft.

CMSTP.exe can also be abused to Bypass User Account Control and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Defense Evasion (TA0005)

**Platforms:** Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if CMSTP technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of CMSTP
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (2 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet

Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```cmd
cmstp.exe /s "#{inf_file_path}"
```

**Dependencies:**

- INF file must exist on disk at specified location (#{inf_file_path})

### Atomic Test 2: CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass

Adversaries may invoke cmd.exe (or other malicious commands) by embedding them in the RunPreSetupCommandsSection of an INF file

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```cmd
cmstp.exe /s "#{inf_file_uac}" /au
```

**Dependencies:**

- INF file must exist on disk at specified location (#{inf_file_uac})

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to CMSTP by examining the target platforms (Windows).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1218.003 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

### M1038 Execution Prevention

Consider using application control configured to block execution of CMSTP.exe if it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.

### M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or Program

CMSTP.exe may not be necessary within a given environment (unless using it for VPN connection installation).

## Detection

### Detection of Malicious Profile Installation via CMSTP.exe
