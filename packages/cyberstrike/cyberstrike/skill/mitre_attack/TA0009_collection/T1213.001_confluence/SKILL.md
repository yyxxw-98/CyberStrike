# T1213.001 Confluence

> **Sub-technique of:** T1213

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information. Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:

- Policies, procedures, and standards
- Physical / logical network diagrams
- System architecture diagrams
- Technical system documentation
- Testing / development credentials (i.e., Unsecured Credentials)
- Work / project schedules
- Source code snippets
- Links to network shares and other internal resources

## Kill Chain Phase

- Collection (TA0009)

**Platforms:** SaaS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Confluence technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check SaaS systems for indicators of Confluence
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (3 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Confluence by examining the target platforms (SaaS).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1213.001 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

> **Note**: No Atomic Red Team tests available for this technique. See [Atomic Red Team GitHub](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) for updates.

## Remediation Guide

### M1017 User Training

Develop and publish policies that define acceptable information to be stored in Confluence repositories.

### M1047 Audit

Consider periodic review of accounts and privileges for critical and sensitive Confluence repositories.

### M1018 User Account Management

Enforce the principle of least-privilege. Consider implementing access control mechanisms that include both authentication and authorization.

## Detection

### Programmatic and Excessive Access to Confluence Documentation
