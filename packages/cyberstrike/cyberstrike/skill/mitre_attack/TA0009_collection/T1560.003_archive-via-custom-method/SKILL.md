# T1560.003 Archive via Custom Method

> **Sub-technique of:** T1560

## High-Level Description

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method. Adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with XOR or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references. Custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Collection (TA0009)

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Archive via Custom Method technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of Archive via Custom Method
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of Archive via Custom Method
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of Archive via Custom Method
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Archive via Custom Method by examining the target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1560.003 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

> **Note**: No Atomic Red Team tests available for this technique. See [Atomic Red Team GitHub](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) for updates.

## Remediation Guide
