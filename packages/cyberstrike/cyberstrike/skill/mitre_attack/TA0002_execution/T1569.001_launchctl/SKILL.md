# T1569.001 Launchctl

> **Sub-technique of:** T1569

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may abuse launchctl to execute commands or programs. Launchctl interfaces with launchd, the service management framework for macOS. Launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input.

Adversaries use launchctl to execute commands and programs as Launch Agents or Launch Daemons. Common subcommands include: <code>launchctl load</code>,<code>launchctl unload</code>, and <code>launchctl start</code>. Adversaries can use scripts or manually run the commands <code>launchctl load -w "%s/Library/LaunchAgents/%s"</code> or <code>/bin/launchctl load</code> to execute Launch Agents or Launch Daemons.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Execution (TA0002)

**Platforms:** macOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Launchctl technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of Launchctl
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Launchctl

Utilize launchctl

**Supported Platforms:** macos

```bash
launchctl submit -l #{label_name} -- #{executable_path}
```

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Launchctl by examining the target platforms (macOS).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1569.001 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

### M1018 User Account Management

Prevent users from installing their own launch agents or launch daemons.

## Detection

### Detection Strategy for System Services: Launchctl

## Risk Assessment

| Finding                        | Severity | Impact    |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | --------- |
| Launchctl technique applicable | Low      | Execution |

## CWE Categories

| CWE ID | Title                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code |
