# T1529 System Shutdown/Reboot

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via Network Device CLI (e.g. <code>reload</code>). They may also include shutdown/reboot of a virtual machine via hypervisor / cloud consoles or command line tools.

Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users while also impeding incident response/recovery.

Adversaries may also use Windows API functions, such as `InitializeSystemShutdownExW` or `ExitWindowsEx`, to force a system to shut down or reboot. Alternatively, the `NtRaiseHardError`or `ZwRaiseHardError` Windows API functions with the `ResponseOption` parameter set to `OptionShutdownSystem` may deliver a “blue screen of death” (BSOD) to a system. In order to leverage these API functions, an adversary may need to acquire `SeShutdownPrivilege` (e.g., via Access Token Manipulation).
In some cases, the system may not be able to boot again.

Adversaries may attempt to shutdown/reboot a system after impacting it in other ways, such as Disk Structure Wipe or Inhibit System Recovery, to hasten the intended effects on system availability.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Impact (TA0040)

**Platforms:** ESXi, Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if System Shutdown/Reboot technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check ESXi systems for indicators of System Shutdown/Reboot
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of System Shutdown/Reboot
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of System Shutdown/Reboot
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Shutdown System - Windows

This test shuts down a Windows system.

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```cmd
shutdown /s /t #{timeout}
```

### Atomic Test 2: Restart System - Windows

This test restarts a Windows system.

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```cmd
shutdown /r /t #{timeout}
```

### Atomic Test 3: Restart System via `shutdown` - FreeBSD/macOS/Linux

This test restarts a FreeBSD/macOS/Linux system.

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```bash
shutdown -r #{timeout}
```

### Atomic Test 4: Shutdown System via `shutdown` - FreeBSD/macOS/Linux

This test shuts down a FreeBSD/macOS/Linux system using a halt.

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```bash
shutdown -h #{timeout}
```

### Atomic Test 5: Restart System via `reboot` - FreeBSD/macOS/Linux

This test restarts a FreeBSD/macOS/Linux system via `reboot`.

**Supported Platforms:** linux, macos
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```bash
reboot
```

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to System Shutdown/Reboot by examining the target platforms (ESXi, Linux, macOS).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1529 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection

### Multi-Platform Shutdown or Reboot Detection via Execution and Host Status Events
