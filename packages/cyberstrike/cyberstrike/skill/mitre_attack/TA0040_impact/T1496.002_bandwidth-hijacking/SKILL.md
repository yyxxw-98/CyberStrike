# T1496.002 Bandwidth Hijacking

> **Sub-technique of:** T1496

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may leverage the network bandwidth resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.

Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate Network Denial of Service campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents. Alternatively, they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network bandwidth and IP address to proxyware services. Finally, they may engage in internet-wide scanning in order to identify additional targets for compromise.

In addition to incurring potential financial costs or availability disruptions, this technique may cause reputational damage if a victim’s bandwidth is used for illegal activities.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Impact (TA0040)

**Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS, IaaS, Containers

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Bandwidth Hijacking technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Linux systems for indicators of Bandwidth Hijacking
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of Bandwidth Hijacking
- [ ] Check macOS systems for indicators of Bandwidth Hijacking
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to Bandwidth Hijacking by examining the target platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1496.002 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

> **Note**: No Atomic Red Team tests available for this technique. See [Atomic Red Team GitHub](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) for updates.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection

### Detect Excessive or Unauthorized Bandwidth Usage for Botnet, Proxyjacking, or Scanning Purposes
