# T1631 Process Injection

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

Both Android and iOS have no legitimate way to achieve process injection. The only way this is possible is by abusing existing root access or exploiting a vulnerability.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Defense Evasion (TA0030)
- Privilege Escalation (TA0029)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Process Injection technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Process Injection
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Process Injection
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Process Injection by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1631 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection

### Detection of Process Injection
