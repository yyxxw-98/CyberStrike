# T1655.001 Match Legitimate Name or Location

> **Sub-technique of:** T1655

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by giving artifacts the name and icon of a legitimate, trusted application (i.e., Settings), or using a package name that matches legitimate, trusted applications (i.e., `com.google.android.gm`).

Adversaries may also use the same icon of the file or application they are trying to mimic.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Defense Evasion (TA0030)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Match Legitimate Name or Location technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Match Legitimate Name or Location
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Match Legitimate Name or Location
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Match Legitimate Name or Location by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).
