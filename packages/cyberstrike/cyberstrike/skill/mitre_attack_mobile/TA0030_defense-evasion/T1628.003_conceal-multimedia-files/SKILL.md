# T1628.003 Conceal Multimedia Files

> **Sub-technique of:** T1628

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may attempt to hide multimedia files from the user. By doing so, adversaries may conceal captured files, such as pictures, videos and/or screenshots, then later exfiltrate those files.

Specific to Android devices, if the `.nomedia` file is present in a folder, multimedia files in that folder will not be visible to the user in the Gallery application. Additionally, other applications are asked not to scan the folder with the `.nomedia` file, effectively making the folder appear invisible to the user.

This technique is often used by stalkerware and spyware applications.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Defense Evasion (TA0030)

**Platforms:** Android

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Conceal Multimedia Files technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Conceal Multimedia Files
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Conceal Multimedia Files by examining the target platforms (Android).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1628.003 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1059 Do Not Mitigate

Conceal Multimedia Files likely should not be mitigated with preventative controls because the `.nomedia` file may be used legitimately.
