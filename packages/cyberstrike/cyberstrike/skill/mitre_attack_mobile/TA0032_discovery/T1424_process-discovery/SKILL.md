# T1424 Process Discovery

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a device. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on devices within a network. Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

Recent Android security enhancements have made it more difficult to obtain a list of running processes. On Android 7 and later, there is no way for an application to obtain the process list without abusing elevated privileges. This is due to the Android kernel utilizing the `hidepid` mount feature. Prior to Android 7, applications could utilize the `ps` command or examine the `/proc` directory on the device.

In iOS, applications have previously been able to use the `sysctl` command to obtain a list of running processes. This functionality has been removed in later iOS versions.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Discovery (TA0032)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Process Discovery technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Process Discovery
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Process Discovery
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (2 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Process Discovery by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1424 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1006 Use Recent OS Version

Android 7 and later iOS versions introduced changes that prevent applications from performing Process Discovery without elevated privileges.

### M1002 Attestation

Attestation can typically detect rooted devices. For MDM-enrolled devices, action can be taken if a device fails an attestation check.
