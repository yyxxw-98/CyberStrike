# T1474.002 Compromise Hardware Supply Chain

> **Sub-technique of:** T1474

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Initial Access (TA0027)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Compromise Hardware Supply Chain technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Compromise Hardware Supply Chain by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1474.002 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1001 Security Updates

Security updates may contain patches to integrity checking mechanisms that can detect unauthorized hardware modifications.

## Detection

### Detection of Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
