# T1641 Data Manipulation

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may insert, delete, or alter data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application, process, and the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Impact (TA0034)

**Platforms:** Android

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Data Manipulation technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Data Manipulation
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Data Manipulation by examining the target platforms (Android).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1641 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1006 Use Recent OS Version

Recent OS versions have limited access to certain APIs unless certain conditions are met, making Data Manipulation more difficult

## Detection

### Detection of Data Manipulation
