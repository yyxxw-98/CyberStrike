# T1430.001 Remote Device Management Services

> **Sub-technique of:** T1430

## High-Level Description

An adversary may use access to cloud services (e.g. Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find my iPhone) or to an enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) server console to track the location of mobile devices managed by the service.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Collection (TA0035)
- Discovery (TA0032)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Remote Device Management Services technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Remote Device Management Services
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Remote Device Management Services
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (2 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Remote Device Management Services by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1430.001 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1011 User Guidance

Users should protect their account credentials and enable multi-factor authentication options when available.

### M1012 Enterprise Policy

If devices are enrolled using Apple User Enrollment or using a profile owner enrollment mode for Android, device controls prevent the enterprise from accessing the device’s physical location. This is typically used for a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployment.
