# T1417.001 Keylogging

> **Sub-technique of:** T1417

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials or other information from the user as the user types them.

Some methods of keylogging include:

- Masquerading as a legitimate third-party keyboard to record user keystrokes. On both Android and iOS, users must explicitly authorize the use of third-party keyboard apps. Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.
- Abusing accessibility features. On Android, adversaries may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type. The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed.
  \*Additional methods of keylogging may be possible if root access is available.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Collection (TA0035)
- Credential Access (TA0031)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Keylogging technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Keylogging
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Keylogging
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (2 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Keylogging by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1417.001 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1012 Enterprise Policy

When using Samsung Knox, third-party keyboards must be explicitly added to an allow list in order to be available to the end-user.

### M1011 User Guidance

Users should be wary of granting applications dangerous or privacy-intrusive permissions, such as keyboard registration or accessibility service access.
