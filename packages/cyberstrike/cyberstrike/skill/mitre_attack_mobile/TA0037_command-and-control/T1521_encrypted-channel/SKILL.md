# T1521 Encrypted Channel

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may explicitly employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if necessary secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Command and Control (TA0037)

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Encrypted Channel technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Encrypted Channel
- [ ] Check iOS devices for indicators of Encrypted Channel
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Encrypted Channel by examining the target platforms (Android, iOS).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1521 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

No specific mitigations documented for this technique.

## Detection
