# T1626 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

## High-Level Description

Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevated privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can gain on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that are designated as higher risk. An adversary can use several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.

## Kill Chain Phase

- Privilege Escalation (TA0029)

**Platforms:** Android

## What to Check

- [ ] Identify if Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism technique is applicable to target mobile environment
- [ ] Check Android devices for indicators of Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
- [ ] Verify mitigations are bypassed or absent (1 known mitigations)
- [ ] Assess detection coverage (1 detection strategies)

## How to Test

### Identify Attack Surface

Determine if the target mobile environment is susceptible to Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism by examining the target platforms (Android).

### Assess Existing Defenses

Review whether mitigations for T1626 are in place. If defenses are absent or misconfigured, this technique may be exploitable.

## Remediation Guide

### M1013 Application Developer Guidance

Applications very rarely require administrator permission. Developers should be cautioned against using this higher degree of access to avoid being flagged as a potentially malicious application.

## Detection

### Detection of Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
